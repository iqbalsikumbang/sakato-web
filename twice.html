            <h1>Survival through SIXTEEN and the Beginning of Twice</h1>
            <p>On December 19, 2013, JYP Entertainment (JYPE) announced that they would debut
                a new girl group in the first half of 2014, the first female group to come out
                of the company since the debut of Miss A in 2010. On February 27, 2014, JYPE trainees Lena and Cecilia
                were confirmed as members of the group tentatively called
                as 6mix, while other rumoured members included JYPE trainees Nayeon, Jeongyeon, Jisoo (later Jihyo) and
                Minyoung. On February 11, 2015, Park Jin-young announced
                that the lineup of JYPE's upcoming seven-member girl group would be decided through Sixteen, a
                competition survival show that would air on Mnet later that year.
                The show began on May 5 and ended with Nayeon, Jeongyeon, Sana, Jihyo, Mina, Dahyun, and Chaeyoung as
                the seven Twice members. Park then announced that he would
                be increasing the size of the group from seven members to nine by adding Tzuyu, who was the "audience's
                pick" since she was the most popular contestant by the show's end,
                and Momo, who was added by Park himself since he felt the group needed someone with Momo's performance
                abilities. The decision was controversial at the time with many people
                complaining about eliminated contestants being able to join the group.</p>
            <p>On October 7, 2015, JYPE launched the band's official website and announced via
                SNS that the group would debut with the extended play (EP) The Story Begins and single "Like Ooh-Ahh".
                The track was described as a "color pop" dance track with elements of hip-hop, rock, and R&B. The
                composition team included Black Eyed Pilseung, known for composing successful releases
                such as Miss A's "Only You". The album and the song's music video were released on October 20. The group
                held a live showcase the same day, where they performed all tracks from the EP.
                The music video hit 50 million views on YouTube within five months of their debut and became one of the
                most-viewed debut music videos for any K-pop group. On December 27, the band performed
                a remix version of their single "Like Ooh-Ahh" at SBS Gayo Daejeon, Twice's first-ever attendance on a
                year-end music program.</p>

            <h1>Reaching for the top and become famous worldwide</h1>
            <p> Twice's second EP, Page Two, was released on April 25, 2016. The album
                includes
                title track "Cheer Up", "Precious Love" (a remake of Park Ji-yoon's 1998 hit), and "I'm Gonna Be A
                Star",
                which served as the theme song for Sixteen. Twice won their first music program award with "Cheer Up" on
                May
                5, on M Countdown, exactly one year after the initial airing of Sixteen.
                This was soon followed by wins on Music Bank and Inkigayo. In celebration of Twice's first anniversary
                since
                debut on October 20, the group unveiled their new song "One in a Million" from their
                upcoming third EP, Twicecoaster: Lane 1, through a live broadcast on V Live. Twicecoaster: Lane 1 and
                the
                music video of pop dance song "TT" were released online on October 24. "TT" became
                the first music video by a K-pop female act to surpass 200 million views. On June 14, Twice digitally
                released "Signal (Japanese ver.)", along with the short version of its music video, as a preview
                and countdown to their Japanese debut album release. A week later, they released the full music video of
                the
                Japanese version of "TT".</p>
            <p> On October 18, the group released their first Japanese single,
                "One More Time". The single achieved the biggest first-day sales and became the fastest-selling release
                of
                any South Korean girl group in Japan. Twice released their first full-length Korean album,
                Twicetagram, on October 30 with its lead single titled "Likey". The music video for the song was filmed
                in
                Canada in early September. "Likey" was composed by Black Eyed Pilseung and Jeon Gun, and
                was the group's fourth collaboration with Black Eyed Pilseung. The album and its lead single debuted
                atop
                both Billboard's World Albums and World Digital Song Sales respectivelyâ€”the group's first number 1,
                making Twice the first female K-pop act to lead on both charts. They also rose on the Heatseekers Albums
                as
                the album debuted at number 10, one position higher than Signal's peak at number 11.
                The Christmas-inspired reissue of Twicetagram, titled Merry & Happy, along with its title track "Heart
                Shaker" was released on December 11, 2017.</p>
