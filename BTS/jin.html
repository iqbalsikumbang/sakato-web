          by one of the biggest talent agencies in South Korea, SM, but he

          an idol] – Jin, “At first it was really hard but there were lots of
          kids who helped me and treated me really well. They helped me a lot

          used to, particularly over a span of two months. He shared he had an
          experience while he was grilling meat, the oil/fat from the meat
          splashed into his eyes. He's been scared to cook since that incident
          and prefers to order takeout.<br />
          -In an interview, when the members were asked would they rather give
          up their phone, friends, or food for a day, Jin jokingly said he would
