      <h2>~~~Profile of TIFFANY SNSD~~~</h2>
      <p>Stephanie Young Hwang (born August 1, 1989), known professionally
        as Tiffany or Tiffany Young, is an American singer. Born and raised in California, she was discovered by South
        Korean entertainment
        agency SM Entertainment at the age of fifteen and subsequently moved to South Korea. After two years of
