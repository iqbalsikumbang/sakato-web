      <p>Lee Soon-gyu (born May 15, 1989), known professionally as Sunny, is
        an American singer and entertainer based in South Korea. She debuted as a member of girl group Girls' Generation
        (and later its subgroup Girls' Generation-Oh!GG) in August 2007, which
        went on to become one of the best-selling artists in South Korea and one of South Korea's most popular girl
        groups worldwide. Apart from her group's activities, Sunny has participated in numerous side projects including
        original soundtracks, television
        variety shows, musical acting and radio hosting. Aside from Girls' Generation's activities, Sunny has
        participated in a number of side-projects. In early 2008, Sunny worked as a co-host of the Melon Chunji Radio
        with Super Junior's Sungmin. In August 2008,
        she contributed a solo song, "You Don't Know About Love" for the SBS's drama Working Mom. In 2009, Sunny
        released two songs—a solo track "Finally Now" for the interactive movie Story of Wine and a duet "It's Love" for
        the MBC's drama Heading to the Ground,
        with Girls' Generation's member Taeyeon.</p> <p>During 2012-2013, Sunny was cast in her first musical, Catch Me If You
        Can, based on the true story and life of a con man named Frank Abagnale. The story was turned famous by the 2002
        movie of the same name.
        She played a character named Brenda, who is the girlfriend of the male lead. Her performance received favorable
        reviews. Shin Yeong-seon from The Chosun Ilbo noted on Sunny's ability to understand the character and praised
        her well-portrayal of Brenda's
        "exaggerated cuteness and flippant acting". Between 2014-2015, she became a cast member of the SBS's reality
        show Roommate. The show featured a group of celebrities living together, sharing the house as well as household
        tasks. In March 2016, it was
        revealed that Sunny would be a celebrity judge in the new show, Vocal War: God's Voice. The purpose of the show
        is to create a one-on-one vocal battle between veteran singers in Korea and talented amateur vocalists. Starting
        from June 2016, Sunny joined
        the main cast of the JTBC variety show Cheonhajangsa, a show featuring various traditional markets.</p>
