      <h2>~~~Profile of HYOYEON SNSD~~~</h2>
      <p>Kim Hyo-yeon (born September 22, 1989), referred to as Hyoyeon or
        DJ HYO, is a South Korean singer, DJ, and television personality. She debuted as a member of the girl group
        Girls' Generation (and later its subgroup Girls' Generation-Oh!GG) in August 2007,
        which went on to become one of the best-selling artists in South Korea and one of South Korea's most popular
        girl groups worldwide. In January 2013, Hyoyeon made a guest appearance on the television show Blind Test Show
        180 Degrees, where she took on the challenge
        of dancing to various types of club music. In May 2013, Hyoyeon was chosen as an Asian ambassador for the Hong
        Kong branch of Topshop. Since 2016, she has also released singles as a solo artist. In June 2015, Hyoyeon began
        hosting her own reality television
        show, Hyoyeon's One Million Likes, broadcast on OnStyle.</p> <p> Before the show was officially announced, an Instagram
        account was created where Hyoyeon posted pictures and videos with the goal of receiving one million likes from
        fans. On July 1, 2015, Hyoyeon
        became the first Girls' Generation member to publish a book with Hyo Style, in which she shares tips on beauty,
        fashion and lifestyle. The book contains 142 pages and comes with a DVD. On April 12, 2018, S.M. Entertainment
        announced that Hyoyeon would return
        as DJ Hyo with a new single titled "Sober" on April 18 under SM's electronic dance music label Scream Records.
        The new single is a tropical-future house song characterized by electric guitar riffs and hook. It was also
        revealed that she would also be promoting
        actively as a DJ in domestic club tours and EDM festivals under her new stage name.</p>
