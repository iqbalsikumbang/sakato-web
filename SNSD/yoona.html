      <h2>~~~Profile of YOONA SNSD~~~</h2>
      <p>Im Yoon-ah (born May 30, 1990), better known by the mononym Yoona,
        is a South Korean singer and actress. After training for five years, she debuted as a member of girl group
        Girls' Generation
        (and later its subgroup Girls' Generation-Oh!GG) in August 2007, which went on to become one of the best-selling
        artists in South Korea and one of South Korea's most popular girl groups worldwide. Apart from her group's
        activities, Yoona has participated in
        various television dramas, notably You Are My Destiny (2008), which marked her career breakthrough and earned
        her the Best New Actress awards at the 23rd KBS Drama Awards and the 45th Baeksang Arts Awards.</p><p>Yoona has since
        achieved further public attention and
        acting acclaim with a variety of role-types in Love Rain (2012), Prime Minister & I (2013), The K2 (2016) and
        The King in Love (2017). Her film works include Confidential Assignment (2017) and Exit (2019), which became two
        of the highest-grossing films in
        South Korea. On May 30, 2019, Yoona celebrated her 29th birthday (30th in Korean age) with the release of her
        debut extended play A Walk to Remember, which became the fastest-selling album in its first 24 hours
        domestically by a female soloist. The success of
        Yoona's music and acting careers have lead her to various CF deals, notably long-term collaborator Innisfree,
        and have established her as a pioneer idol-actress in her native country.</p>
