            <p>Girls' Generation also known as SNSD, is a South
                Korean girl group formed by SM Entertainment. The group is composed of eight members: Taeyeon,
                Sunny, Tiffany, Hyoyeon, Yuri, Sooyoung, Yoona, and Seohyun. Originally a nine-piece group, Jessica
                departed
                from the group in September 2014. In 2017, 3 members of Girls' Generation decide not to renew their
                contracts to pursue
                their solo career. The group rose to fame with the single "Gee" in 2009, which claimed the top spot on
                KBS's
                Music Bank for a record-breaking nine consecutive weeks and was named the most popular song of the 2000s
                in
                South Korea by Melon.
                Girls' Generation consolidated their popularity in South Korea with follow-up singles "Genie", "Oh!",
                and
                "Run Devil Run", which were released between mid-2009 and early 2010. The group's signature musical
                styles
                are characterized as electropop
                and bubblegum pop, though their sounds have varied widely, incorporating various genres including hip
                hop,
                R&B, and EDM.</p>

            <h1>Assemble, Into The New World, Gee</h1>
            <p>The first member of the group to join SM Entertainment's training system was
                Jessica in 2000, after she and her sister, Krystal Jung, were scouted in a mall in South Korea during a
                family vacation. That same
                year, members Sooyoung and Hyoyeon were cast into S.M.'s training system through the 2000 S.M. Open
                Audition, in which Hyoyeon danced for her audition. Yuri was the next Girls' Generation member to become
                an S.M. trainee after
                coming second in the 2001 S.M. Youth Best Dancer competition. Yoona was cast the following year through
                the 2002 S.M. Saturday Open Casting Audition. Seohyun, the group's youngest member, was scouted in the
                subway by an S.M. scout; she
                then auditioned in 2003, singing children's songs. The group's leader, Taeyeon, was cast in 2004 after
                winning first place in the S.M. Youth Singing Competition. That same year, member Tiffany auditioned at
                S.M.'s Starlight Casting System in
                Los Angeles, and joined the company in October 2004. The final member of the group to be added was
                Sunny, who had become an S.M. trainee in 1998 and trained for five years. In July 2007, Girls'
                Generation had their first stage performance on Mnet's School
                of Rock, where the group performed their first single, "Into the New World". On August 5, 2007, the
                group officially made their debut on SBS's Inkigayo, where they performed the same song.</p>
            <p>Though Girls' Generation had gained some attention with their 2007 debut album,
                it was not until 2009 that the group rose to stardom. On January 7, the group released their debut
                extended play (EP) Gee, which has sold over 100,000 copies in South Korea. Its title track occupied the
                number-one position on KBS's Music Bank after a week of release and remained on the top spot for a
                record-breaking
                nine consecutive weeks, becoming the longest running number-one song on Music Bank until 2012, when
                Psy's "Gangnam Style" claimed the top spot for ten consecutive weeks. It also became the best-selling
                single of 2009 in
                South Korea. The group's second EP Tell Me Your Wish (Genie) and its
                titular lead single were released in June 2009. In November
                2009, S.M. Entertainment announced the group's first concert tour, Into The New World, whose tickets for
                the South
                Korean shows were sold out in three minutes.</p>

            <h1>Breakthrough in Japan, Connect Worldwide</h1>
            <p>Girls' Generation's second studio album Oh! was released in January 2010. Oh! was re-released under the
                title Run Devil Run in March 2010. In September 2010, Girls' Generation released
                the
                Japanese version of "Genie"
                as their debut single in Japan. The following month, the group
                released their second Japanese
                single, "Gee".
                Girls' Generation's third Korean EP Hoot was released in October 2010.
                Girls'
                Generation's third Korean studio album, The Boys, was released in October 2011. The album was released
                in
                the United States by Interscope Records, marking Girls' Generation's debut album in the country.</p>
            <p> To help
                The
                Boys connect
                with audiences worldwide, the group made their debut on US television upon performing on Late Show with
                David Letterman on January 31 and Live! with Kelly on February 1.In April 2012, SM Entertainment formed
                a
                subgroup of Girls'
                Generation named TTS (also known as TaeTiSeo), which is composed of three members: Taeyeon, Tiffany, and
                Seohyun. TTS has released three extended plays: Twinkle (May 2012), Holler (September 2014), and Dear
                Santa
                (December 2015).
                In December 2012, Girls' Generation released "Dancing Queen"—a remake of British singer Duffy's "Mercy"
                (2008)—as the lead single from their then-upcoming 2013 Korean studio album. On New Year's Day of 2013,
                the
                group released their fourth Korean studio album titled I Got a Boy. On the same
                day, the group held an MBC special television program, Girls' Generation's Romantic Fantasy. The album
                was a
                commercial success in South Korea, peaking atop the Gaon Album Chart; it also claimed the top spot of
                Billboard's
                World Albums Chart. </p>

            <p>Girls' Generation released their first remix album, Best Selection Non Stop
                Mix, in
                March, and a live album titled 2011 Girls' Generation Tour in April 2013. Girls'
                Generation's fourth Korean EP, Mr.Mr, was released in February 2014. In July 2014, the group released
                their first Japanese greatest hits

                "Divine",
                "Show Girls", and "Chain Reaction". On
                September 29,
                2014, member Jessica announced that she had been dismissed from the group. SM Entertainment confirmed
                this
                and stated that Jessica was no longer a member of Girls' Generation due to conflicts between her and the
                group's
                schedules. Girls' Generation continued to promote as an eight-member group thereafter. The remaining
                eight
                members proceeded with the group's activities. Girls' Generation announced the single "Catch Me If You
                Can",
                their
                first release as an eight-member group, in March 2015. It was recorded in both Korean and Japanese</p>
            <p>Girls' Generation revealed the cover artwork of their fifth
                Korean
                studio album Lion Heart on August 12, 2015. It was subsequently released by S.M. Entertainment on August
                19,
                2015. Lion
                Heart produced three singles—the first being "Party", which was released in July 2015.
                Following the release of "Party", Girls' Generation appeared on the Billboard Social 50 at number
                forty-four
                on
                August 1, 2015. The group was on a hiatus for the most part of 2016. However, to commemorate the group's
                ninth debut anniversary, in August 2016, a single titled "Sailing (0805)" was released. The lyrics were
                written by member
                Sooyoung, highlighting the relationship between the group and their fans.</p>

            <h1>Indefinite Hiatus</h1>
            <p>In July 2017, Girls' Generation announced the release of their sixth
                Korean-language studio album to commemorate the group's tenth anniversary. The album, titled Holiday
                Night,
                was released on August 7, 2017. It debuted atop the Billboard World Albums chart, and peaked at number 2
                on
                the South Korean Gaon Album Chart. The album surpassed The Boys as Girls' Generation's fastest-selling
                Korean-language
                album in the first week, and sold 167,638 physical copies by end of year. In October 2017, SM
                Entertainment
                announced that members Tiffany, Sooyoung and Seohyun decided not to renew their contracts with the
                company
                to
                focus on their acting or solo music careers. With the change of music labels, the group was said to not
                be
                disbanded and future activities of the eight-member group remains to be discussed. The group is
                currently on
                indefinite
                hiatus to focus on solo activities. In August 2018, SM Entertainment formed the second subgroup of
                Girls'
                Generation named Girls' Generation-Oh!GG, which is composed of five members: Sunny, Taeyeon, Yoona, Yuri
                and
                Hyoyeon.
                They released their debut single album, Lil' Touch, on September 5.</p>
