      <h2>~~~Profile of Mino Winner~~~</h2>
      <p>Song Min-ho better known by the stage name Mino, is a South Korean rapper, songwriter, producer and member of
        boy band Winner, signed under YG Entertainment. He appeared in the survival program Show Me the Money 4
        , where he finished as series runner-up. Alongside Bobby, he is part of the hip hop duo MOBB and released the
        four-track album The Mobb in September 2016. He currently appears as a cast member in the show New Journey to
        the West. Song Min-ho was born on
        March 30, 1993, in Yongin, Gyeonggi Province. He has a younger sister named Dan-ah, who was a member of New F.O.
        He graduated from Hanlim Multi Art School in 2011. He was also a member of the underground rapping scene, under
        the name Mino or Hugeboy Mino,
        collaborating with other underground rappers-turned-idols, namely Block B's Zico, Kyung and P.O, Phantom's
        Hanhae, Speed's Taewoon, and M.I.B's Sims.</p><p> In 2011, Mino debuted as a rapper in the group BoM, under Y2Y
        Contents Company, following disbandment two years later.
        While still active in the group, Mino made his first acting appearance in March 2012 through Channel A cable
        drama The Strongest K-POP Survival. In 2013, Mino was accepted into YG Entertainment through auditions. In the
        same year, he competed as part
        of the trainee group "Team A" in Mnet's reality-survival program Win: Who Is Next. Initially, he was the leader,
        but due to an injury part-way through the show, he was replaced as leader by Kang Seung-yoon. During the finale
        episode on October 25, 2013,
        it was announced that Team A had won the competition, and would be debuting as Winner.</p>
