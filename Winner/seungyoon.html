      <h2>~~~Profile of Seungyoon Winner~~~</h2>
      <p>Kang Seung-yoon (born January 21, 1994), known as Seungyoon or Yoon, is a South Korean singer-songwriter,
        dancer, record producer, actor, and leader of boy group Winner. In 2010, he participated in the reality
        television singing
        contest Superstar K2 and finished in fourth place. In January 2011, he became a trainee under YG Entertainment
        and went on to debut as a solo artist in July 2013 and as the leader of Winner in August 2014. Kang Seung-yoon
        was born
        in Busan, South Korea, on January 21, 1994. He learned to play the guitar in the eighth grade. When he was in
        his last year of junior high, he took lessons in both classic guitar and billiards, going on to become the
        regional representative for billiards.
        On June 20, 2013, Yang Hyun-suk announced on YG Life that Seungyoon would be debuting as a solo artist with the
        single "Wild and Young" composed by Teddy Park.</p><p>On July 15, it was announced that Seungyoon's debut would be
        postponed and
        the following day, another single from his upcoming mini-album titled "It Rains" was released instead. "It
        Rains" achieved an all-kill by placing at number one on all nine major real-time charts in Korea. Seungyoon then
        participated in the survival reality
        program WIN: Who Is Next. The program would involve two teams of YG trainees (A and B) that would compete
        against each other for the chance to debut at the end of the series. In the seventh episode of WIN: Who Is Next,
        Seungyoon replaced bandmate
        Song Min-ho as the leader of "Team A". On October 25, it was announced that Team A had won the series and would
        debut as Winner.</p>

      <h2>~~~Fun Facts~~~</h2>
      <p style="text-indent:0;">-Seungyoon’s traits are described to be a rational and self-conscious person as he pays
        attention to the other people even when he is eating. He often confines himself because of his anxiety. <br>
        -Seungyoon learned to play the guitar when he was in the eighth grade. He also took lessons in billiards when he
        was in his last year of junior high. <br>
        -Seungyoon likes fried rice and picked ‘Shooting Star’ and ‘Very Berry Strawberry’ as the ice cream flavors he
        likes the most from Baskin-Robbins. On the other hand, Seungyoon cannot eat peaches and apples. <br>
        -Seungyoon himself claims to be a look-alike of actors Lee Jun-ki and So Ji-sub.<br>
        -Seungyoon is good friends with GOT7‘s JB.<br>
        -The first thing that Seungyoon does after he wakes up is sit up in the bed and search his name online on his
        phone. He actively searches for hate comments on articles written about him. He reasoned that he feels nervous
        because
        there are fewer hate comments toward him compared to the old days which made him wonder whether he had gotten
        too comfortable. <br>
        -Seungyoon does not play games because he may get addicted once he starts playing. <br>
        -Seungyoon will keep apologizing when he is drunk. He believes he is being a nuisance, hence his polite
        demeanor. <br>
        -Seungyoon wears hairpieces to add volume to his hair. <br>
        -Seungyoon said that he has complained about by Yang Hyun-suk for making old-fashioned songs. Therefore, he has
        not played the guitar for a long time because of WINNER’s different music genre. <br>
        -Seungyoon donated KRW 30 million ($26,710 USD) and KRW 5 million ($4,451 USD) for the Seungil Hope Foundation
        in order to support people with Lou Gehrig’s disease. <br>
