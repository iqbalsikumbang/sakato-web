        <p>
             2NE1 was first mentioned by South Korean press in late 2004. Both
          Spica's Bohyung and Fiestar's Linzy were trainees alongside the 2NE1
          members. However, they were eliminated before debut. YG Entertainment
          formally announced in early 2009 that the group would consist of four
          members and debut sometime in May of that year. 2NE1's first extended play 2NE1 (2009) was preceded by two
          singles. The first one, "Lollipop", was recorded with label mate Big
          Bang and released on March 27, 2009  The second single, "Fire",  was released that May and contained
          elements of hip-hop and reggae. Within the first 24 hours of
          release, the videos each received over one million views. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Both the
          song "Fire" and the group became popular online search terms. The
          final single, "I Don't Care", was released simultaneously alongside
          their first eponymous EP in July. At the peak of their career and prior to their split, 2NE1 was
          considered one of the most successful and popular girl groups in South
          Korea. Billboard magazine ranked 2NE1 as one
          of the best K-pop girl groups of the past decade while The New York
          Times named 2NE1's performance at the Prudential Center in New Jersey
          as one of the "Best Concerts of 2012".

        <p>
          In 2010, 2NE1 unexpectedly released "Try to Follow Me" in February .
          The song peaked at number one on the Gaon Digital Chart. That summer,
          2NE1 traveled to Los Angeles and London to record English songs for an
          American debut album with The Black Eyed Peas's member and music
          producer will.i.am. The group recorded a total of 10 songs in their
          initial sessions. The quartet's first full-length album, To Anyone
          (2010), was released on September 9, and debuted at number 7 on the
          Billboard World Album Chart. A fifth song "Don't Stop the Music" was
          recorded as a "special gift for Thai fans". 
        </p>
        <p>
          At the 2010 Mnet Asian
          Music Awards, 2NE1 took home the most accolades: "Artist of the Year",
          "Best Music Video" for "Can't Nobody", "Best Female Group", and "Album
          of the Year" award. Their Japanese debut single "Go Away" was released
          as a ringtone on March 9. 2NE1 debuted at #24 on the Oricon charts.
          Initial plans for their official Japanese debut on Music Station were
          postponed to later that year due to the earthquake.

          sold-out solo concert at the Olympic Hall in the Chamsil Olympic Park
          on August 26, 27 and 28 in Seoul, South Korea. On March 28, 2012, 2NE1
          released their first full-length Japanese album Collection along with
          their second Japanese single "Scream". The album includes Japanese
          remakes of their Korean songs such as "Love Is Ouch", "Fire", and "I

        <h1>Disbandment</h1>
        <p>
          Following the suspension of Bom's contract due to her 2014 drug
          scandal, other members began exploring independent ventures, sending
          the group effectively into hiatus. Dara re-established her acting
          career by starring in web dramas such as Dr.Ian and We Broke Up. Minzy
          opened the Millennium Dance Academy. CL embarked a solo career in the
          United States with the release of "Hello Bitches" from her upcoming EP
          Lifted. The group's only activity in 2015 was a surprise performance
          at the 2015 Mnet Asian Music Awards in Hong Kong. After CL's
          performance of her solo singles "The Baddest Female" and "Hello
          Bitches", all members reunited to perform "Fire" and "I Am the Best".
          After a year of hiatus, YG Entertainment confirmed the departure of
          Minzy in April 2016, stating that the group will continue as a trio.
          Later that November, however, YG Entertainment announced the
          disbandment of the group. CL and Dara remained signed as solo artists,
          while Bom was released from her contract. A last single, "Goodbye",
          was released in January 2017 as a farewell to their fans, inspired by
          a letter CL initially wrote to Minzy.
