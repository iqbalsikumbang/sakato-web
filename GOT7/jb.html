    <div class="title">      
      <p style="text-indent:0;"> -He also likes seeing funny pictures or fanart of himself.<br>
        -He really likes Soul Music.<br>
        -He participated in a short series called “Dream Knight” alongside his fellow GOT7 members.<br>
        -JB wrote the lyrics to GOT7’s song, “Bad Things”.<br>
        -He shares a room with YoungJae. Now all the members have separate rooms and only BamBam and Yugyeom shares a
        room.<br>
        -Their room was called "Vocalist Dorm"<br>
        -He had his first kiss when he was 13.<br>
        -To prepare for their “Girls Girls Girls” comeback, JB had to “fix his image” in order to develop the right
        level of confidence for the song.<br>
        -He has been a fan of pop music since he was 7 years old.<br>
        -He started taking dancing seriously after being introduced to a senior at his high school who danced.<br>
        -There were rumors that JB was so pretty when he was a child that he even took part in a Child Model
        Contest.<br>
        -According to Bambam, Jaebum is the sexiest member.<br>
        -In 2016, JB was unable to participate in several Got7's Fly Tour concerts and a M!Countdown performance due to
        a spinal disc injury. He discovered he had an issue with his spinal disc after being diagnosed, having gone to
        the hospital on April 27 during a concert rehearsal after experiencing severe back pains.<br>
        -He has a PSP but he plays only when he is in the dorm.<br>
        -He is a very stress person.<br>
        -He originally got the idea for the name "Def Soul" from Musiq Soulchild, after hearing the word def in one of
        his songs. The name really means Best Soul.<br>
        -He sings the OST in Dream Knight, Forever Love.<br>
        -The stage name "JB" comes from sharing a similar name to a famous senior singer Yim Jae-beom.<br>
        -It was very difficult for him first to be the leader : "If I became too familiar with the members that might
        interfere with my duties as a leader. That line has always been difficult. Even when I was going through hard
        times, I didn't confide too much in my members, and worked to handle it by myself. So I'm always more
        comfortable around hyungs."</p>      <a href="https://kprofiles.com/got7-members-profile/" class="nav nav--middle">Fun-facts: <br> kprofiles</a>
