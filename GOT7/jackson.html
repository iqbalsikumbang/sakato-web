      <h2>~~~Profile of JACKSON GOT7~~~</h2>
      <p>Jackson Wang (born 28 March 1994) is a Hong Kong rapper, singer and
        dancer based in South Korea. He is a member of the South Korean boy group Got7
        under JYP Entertainment, and is known for his appearances on Korean reality television, notably Roommate. He is
        also active in China as a solo artist and TV host. Born and raised in Hong Kong,
        Wang was a sabre fencer for Hong Kong's fencing team. He was ranked eleventh in the 2010 Summer Youth Olympics,
        and won first place at the Asian Junior and Cadet Fencing Championships in 2011.
        After passing a music audition, he moved to Seoul, South Korea in July 2011 to pursue a career in K-pop. In
        January 2014, after over two years of training, Wang debuted as a member of Got7
        with the single "Girls Girls Girls".</p><p>Wang was born in Kowloon Tong, British Hong Kong on 28 March 1994, and grew
        up in Sha Tin District, New Territories. His father, Wang Ruiji, was a member of
        China's national fencing team and an Asian Games gold medalist. His mother, Sophia Chow, was a former acrobatics
        gymnast from Shanghai, China. In 2010, while playing basketball at his school, he
        was noted by a representative of South Korean talent agency JYP Entertainment and invited to participate in the
        auditions in Kowloon, which he passed in December 2010, five or six months later. 
        After two and a half years of training, Wang was selected as a final member of JYPE new boy group Got7 and
      debuted with the single "Girls Girls Girls", released on 16 January 2014, from the group's first EP Got It?.</p>

      On 29 April 2016, Got7 held their first concert in Seoul, where Wang performed his self-composed songs "I Love
      It" and "WOLO (We Only Live Once)" with his group members Yugyeom and BamBam.
      In November 2017, prior to the release of Got7 second Japanese extended play "Turn Up", Wang dropped out of all
      group activities in Japan due to health concerns and conflicting schedules.</p>
