        Xiumin learned martial arts and has a black belt in Kendo and Taekwondo. Before Xiumin's participation in SM's
        Everysing Contest, he had auditioned for JYP in 2008 but was rejected. In 2008, Xiumin won second place in the
        SM Everysing Contest. He later became

        together with Chen and Baekhyun, Xiumin
        became a member of Exo's first official sub unit Exo-CBX. The group made their debut with the extended play Hey
        Mama! on October 31. Xiumin enlisted for his mandatory military service on May 7, 2019, serving active duty. He
        performed his final concerts
        before his enlistment with Exo-CBX's Magical Circus - Special Edition concert in Japan, and his solo fan meeting
        concert, Xiuweet Time, at Jamsil Arena on May 4. Following his enlistment, he released his debut solo single,
        "You", which is part of
