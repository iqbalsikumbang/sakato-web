      <h2>~~~Profile of CHEN EXO~~~</h2>
      <p>Kim Jong-dae (born September 21, 1992), better known by his stage name Chen, is a South Korean singer and
        songwriter. He debuted in 2012 as a member of the South Korean-Chinese boy band Exo,
        its sub-group Exo-M and its sub-unit Exo-CBX, as well as SM Entertainment's ballad group SM the Ballad. He is
        predominantly known for his role as the main vocalist in Exo. Apart from his group's
        activities, Chen also recorded original soundtracks for various TV series, notably "The Best Luck" for It's
        Okay, That's Love (2014) and "Everytime" for Descendants of the Sun (2016). He made
        his solo debut on April 1, 2019, with the EP April, and a Flower. Chen became a trainee through SM
        Entertainment's Casting System in 2011 when he was 19 years old. On December 29, 2011, he was
        formally introduced as the fourth member of Exo. He made his first public appearance as an Exo member alongside
        Luhan, Tao, and Kai at the 2011 SBS Gayo Daejeon. Later in October 2016, together with
        Baekhyun and Xiumin, Chen became a member of Exo's first sub unit Exo-CBX. The group made their debut with the
        extended play Hey Mama!.</p>
      <h2>~~~Fun Facts~~~</h2>
      <p style="text-indent:0;"> -He is said to be the best singer in EXO. <br>
        -He can hit high notes very easily.<br>
        -His father is a main vocalist as well.<br>
        -His most memorable moment pre-debut was when the company threw him a birthday party.<br>
        -He wasn’t into playing video games, but after living with the members of EXO, he finds himself playing them
        more and more.<br>
        -He hopes to collaborate with Super Junior someday.

      <p style="text-indent:0;"> 
      -He really wants to perfect Mandarin so that he can both speak to his Chinese fans, as well as make less errors
        while recording music.<br>
        -He’s forgetful, so he’ll have to write things down (hence why his notebook is one of his favorite
        possessions).<br>
        -He is one of the worst dancers in EXO, but that doesn’t necessarily mean he’s bad. He’s still an exceptional
        dancer, however, he knows that he has to become better.<br>
        -A fan called him “Dancing Machine” at an event, causing the other EXO members to roar with laughter. The
        nickname has stuck ever since.<br>
        -He says that later on, he’ll master dancing, but for now, he’ll work on perfecting his singing.<br>
        -He says that he admires Kris’s handsomeness, but he especially admires Tao’s ongoing humbleness. He likes how
        if Tao doesn’t understand something, he won’t hesitate to ask for help.<br>
        -He is the friendliest member at fansign events. He is very conversational, and treats fans, especially noona
        fans, very well. He laughs at all of his fan’s jokes, no matter if they’re bad.<br>
        -He treats his fans very well. At an airport, a fan accidentally dropped her phone after someone bumped into
        her. Chen told all of the fans to be careful and watch their steps. He went over to pick up the phone and return
        it to the fan.<br>
        -He is considered the troll of the group, always messing with the other members.<br>
        -Even though he seems quiet in some interviews, he’s actually very hyper, especially when he’s gets to speak
        Korean instead of Mandarin.<br>
        -He’s very close with Xiumin, and they’re seen almost always side-by-side.<br>

      <p style="text-indent:0;"> 
      -He rooms up with Lay in Korea, and Kris in China.<br>
        -He debuted at the 2011 SBS Gayo Daejun alongside Luhan, Tao, and Kai.<br>
        -He believes he’s the best vocalist in EXO (which is true).<br>
        -He has very prominent cheek bones that the other members are jealous of.<br>
        -However, despite having a great singing voice and good cheekbones, he says that his main charm is his beautiful
        legs. He especially likes his small feet (not joking).<br>
        -He says that he’s stubborn and likes to get what he wants.<br>
        -He doesn’t like people touching his ears.<br>
        -His dream is to become the world’s best singer.<br>
        -While he likes being complimented on his voice, he especially lights up when people compliment him on his
        looks, which ironically doesn’t happen very often.<br>
        -He is very considerate. Once when Lay injured his back during dance practice, Chen brought him to the
        hospital.<br>
        -He also rushed over to Xiumin on a variety show when Xiumin injured himself.<br>
        -Chen is becoming better at Mandarin, and at some points during interviews, he can respond to the MC’s questions
        before the translator gets a chance to do their job.<br>
        -It’s unknown how fluent he is in English, however, after watching a few interviews… it’s not that he isn’t
        fluent in English, because there definitely is a foreign accent when he speaks, but at the same time, his
        English sounds awesome. How is this possible? He makes it possible.<br>
        -He is one of the most underrated members of EXO, alongside Xiumin.<br>
        -He joined SM Entertainment in 2011 after being scouted out by an agent.<br>
        -Before joining SM Entertainment, he was auditioning for a music conservatory.<br>
        -He always dreamed about becoming a singer.<br>
        -Before debuting, his parents was against him becoming a singer, but when they learned that it was SM
        Entertainment who offered him the opportunity, they became supportive.<br>
        -He wasn’t a trainee for very long. He made his debut a little before a year after joining SM.<br>
        -His ideal type is a woman who is like a noona. Someone that will be able to take care of him.</p>        <a href="https://kprofiles.com/exo-members-profile/" class="nav nav--middle">Fun-facts: <br> kprofiles</a>
