      <h2>~~~Profile of TAO ex-EXO~~~</h2>
      <p>Huang Zitao (born May 2, 1993), also known as Tao, is a Chinese
        singer-songwriter, rapper, actor and model. After leaving the South Korean-Chinese boy band
        Exo, he made his solo debut in China 2015 with the mini-album TAO, under the new stage name Z.Tao. Huang made
        his acting debut in the romantic movie You Are My Sunshine and later received
        recognition for his leading role in Negotiator.Huang Zitao was born in Qingdao, Shandong, China on May 2, 1993.
        As a child, he undertook Wushu training and became a student athlete.
        In late 2010 he was scouted by a representative from SM Entertainment at a talent show. On December 27, 2011,
        Huang was formally introduced as the third member of Exo (with the stage name Tao).
        In June 2015, Huang set up a Chinese agency, 黄子韬Z.TAO Studio. On August 24, he filed a lawsuit against SM
        Entertainment to terminate his contract. Huang claimed the 10-year contract had
        unjust terms and said he lacks freedom due to the long contract period. However, the Supreme Court dismissed
        Huang's appeal on March 15, 2018. The exclusive contract between SM Entertainment
        and Huang is still valid. In China, SM Entertainment filed a lawsuit against Huang regarding his solo
        activities. Chinese courts ruled that Huang was entitled to use his name and image for
        solo activities in China, and dismissed the lawsuit.</p>

      <h2>~~~Fun Facts~~~</h2>
      <p style="text-indent:0;"> -During his time as a trainee, he was picked on by other trainees because he was Chinese and because he got to
        debut so quickly after joining SM Entertainment.<br>
        -He also says that since he was the trainee for the shortest amount of time, when he was picked to be part of
        EXO, he had to work 10x as hard as everyone else in order to catch up.<br>
        -Tao’s first TV appearance was on SBS’s Gayo Daejun on December 29th, 2011. He appeared alongside Kai, Luhan,
        and Chen.<br>
        -His favorite animal is a black cat.<br>
        -He’s very conservative (kept to himself and mysterious).<br>
        -In China, his roommate is Xiumin. In Korea, his roommate is his manager (his manager thought it’d be best
        because Tao still needs to work on his Korean), and on the road he rooms up with Kris.<br>
        -He won first place in many Wushu and rap competitions.<br>
        -He says that the secret to taking selcas is to take a whole lot of them to figure out your best angles.<br>
        -He says that out of all of the EXO members, he believes he has the best stature… and that he’s also the best
        rapper.<br>
        -He says he never leaves the house without his earphones and cologne.<br>
        -He says that his ideal profession would be a “boss” of something.</p>

      <p style="text-indent:0;"> 
  -His ideal type is someone who is pretty, has a great personality, and has a good body. She has to appear to be
        elegant, yet cold like a princess, but have a bright and kind personality. He likes quiet girls who aren’t too
        straight forward.<br>
        -He says that when it comes to his significant other’s birthdays, not only would he spoil her with presents and
        cake, but he would take her to the ocean to spend her birthday with her.<br>
        -He knows how to speak Mandarin, Cantonese, English, and Korean.<br>
        -Contrary to what the other EXO members say, Tao insists that he isn’t afraid of showering a lone. He says that
        he’s used to showering with other people due to EXO’s cramped dorms, so when he’s showering by himself, it gets
        lonely.<br>
        -He prefers to walk on the beach by himself.<br>
        -He has an obsession with Gucci and with his success, you can expect him to frequent their stores.<br>
        -He says that he gets his face from his mother and his personality from his father.<br>
        -He says he does yoga and runs every day.<br>
        -He drives a Maserati now. He has been seen with it multiple times, picking up and dropping off Sehun or driving
        D.O to his events.<br>
        -He and Sehun go to many famous places in South Korea together to hang out. One of his favorite memories was
        going to Bukak Skyway with Sehun where he got to overlook all of Seoul.<br>
        -The most sentimental place for Tao is the Han River. He goes to the Han River whenever he is stressed out. He
        can unwind there and bathe in all of the personal memoreis that that place holds for him.<br>
        -In 2015, it was discovered that Tao smokes cigarettes.<br>
        -In 2015, Tao’s father released a statement saying that he will sue SM Entertainment and cancel Tao’s contract
        with EXO.<br>
        -Soon afterwards, Tao silently left EXO to pursue his dreams of becoming a solo artist and actor.</p>        <a href="https://kprofiles.com/exo-members-profile/" class="nav nav--middle">Fun-facts: <br> kprofiles</a>
