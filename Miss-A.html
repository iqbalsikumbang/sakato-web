            <p>Miss A was a South Korean girl group formed by JYP Entertainment. The group debuted in
                July 2010 with the single "Bad Girl Good Girl" as a quartet consisting of Fei, Jia, Min, and Suzy. Their
                second studio album, Hush (2013), was well received by critics, and its title track has been covered on
                numerous occasions by girl groups and on survival reality shows. This would be followed by a year-long
                hiatus, until the release of their third extended play, Colors (2015), which would go on to become their
                last release before disbandment. Member Jia left the group in May 2016, while member Min left the group
                in November 2017. In December 2017, JYP officially announced that the group has disbanded.</p>

            <h1>Debut, Bad Girl Good Girl</h1>
            <p>Originally, the group consisted of five trainees who were formed by JYP Entertainment in 2010. They first
                appeared in Chinese variety shows performing dance routines and songs as the "Chinese Wonder Girls,"
                with Woo Hyerim as a member, who was placed in Wonder Girls soon before Miss A's debut in order to
                replace Sunmi. In March 2010, fifteen-year-old trainee Bae Suzy joined the group which, then a trio
                became known as 'Miss A'. Lee Min Young, a solo artist and a long-time trainee in America, also made a
                cameo appearance in the music video, and joined the group for their South Korean debut in April 2010.
                Miss A made their official debut in South Korea as a four-member group on July 1 with their single "Bad
                Girl Good Girl." The song was taken from their debut single album Bad but Good.</p>
            <p>The group later on made their comeback with their second single album called "Step Up" on September 26.
                The group promoted "Breathe" as the lead single for the single album and showed an "exotic and doll-like
                transformation" that was completely different from their debut EP. In May 2011, Miss A released "Love
                Alone", a single from their unreleased album A Class. "Love Alone" was used as a promotional song for
                Yuna Kim's ice show, and Miss A performed the song at the opening of "All That Skate Spring
                2011". Miss A announced their comeback with their first full album called A Class, which was released
                digitally
                on July 18, 2011. A Class consists of a mix of previously released hits and four new tracks, including
                the single "Good Bye Baby".</p>

                a Man" was also included on Miss A's next album, Hush.

                million views on YouTube within 24 hours. Following the end of Colors promotions, Miss A became inactive
                indefinitely. In May 2016, Jia left the
                group; according to management, the other members were focusing on solo activities at the time. In
                November 2017, it was reported that Min had also departed from the group as her contract with JYP
                Entertainment had come to an end. On December 27, 2017, JYP confirmed that the group had disbanded.</p>
