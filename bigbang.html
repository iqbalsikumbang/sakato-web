            <h1>BIGBANG Candidates, "Lies", Hot Issue</h1>
            <p>G-Dragon and Taeyang were the first ones to receive training under YG
                Entertainment at the age of eleven. After G-Dragon was approached by YG Entertainment for possible
                candidates
                to start a boy group, G-Dragon contacted T.O.P, his childhood friend to audition.
                At the time, T.O.P was an underground rapper under the stage name "Tempo". Seungri first appeared on the reality television series Let's Cokeplay:
                Mnet Battle Shinhwa.
                The original lineup consisted of six members: the aforementioned ones along with Daesung and Hyun-seung,
                who were both auditioned in. Big Bang held their official debut on August 19, 2006 at Olympic Gymnastics Arena in Seoul
                during the YG Family 10th Anniversary Concert, which was broadcast the following month. Their first
                single "Bigbang",
                released shortly thereafter, contained the songs "We Belong Together", featuring label mate Park Bom; "A
                Fool's Only Tears" and "This Love", an adaptation of the American rock band Maroon 5 song, rewritten and
                performed by
                G-Dragon. The second single, "BigBang Is V.I.P", was
                released in September. Their last single, "Bigbang 03", followed,
                with final sales
                nearing 40,000 copies. In December, the group held their first concert, The Real, at Olympic
                Gymnastics Arena
                for 12,000 fans.</p>
            <p>Their first extended play, Always (2007), marked several changes for the group.
                 G-Dragon composed and wrote
                most of the tracks, including the lead single "Lies". The EP also saw the introduction of electronic
                music for Big
                Bang. Receptions were fairly positive, most notably in regards to "Lies", which critics described as
                "through the roof". Their second EP, Hot Issue, released in November of the same
                year, contained six tracks all written by G-Dragon, who was also the album's producer. Hot Issue
                followed its
                predecessor's success: the lead-single, "Last Farewell", topped various charts. "Fool" and "But I Love U", other tracks from the EP. They also staged their Big Bang is Great concert, with tickets selling out in 10 minutes. Due
                to over-performing and exhaustion, several members were hospitalized, halting promotional activities.
                Despite this,
                their albums and singles were in high demand, causing the record company to reprint and repackage them
                for re-release.</p>

            <h1>Stand Up, Remember, Sub-Unit</h1>
            <p>Their first Japanese EP, For the World (2008), charted at number 10 on the
                Oricon
                chart with minimal promotion. The group also held a concert at the JCB Hall in Tokyo Dome City.
                Big Bang returned to South Korea after their promotions in Japan ended. Although group activities were
                delayed due to solo projects, their third Korean EP, Stand Up, was released. Featuring artists such as
                Daishi Dance and the
                Korean rock-band No Brain, Stand Up exceeded the 200,000 mark in sales. "Day by Day", the lead single,
                topped several online charts and held the number one position for seven consecutive weeks. Their second
                Korean studio album,
                Remember (2008), yielded the number one single, "Sunset Glow", a remake of the song of the same name by
                Lee
                Moon-se, released in 1988. "Strong Baby", performed solely by Seungri, was released as the second
                single.
                Big Bang received their second Artist of the Year Award from the 2008
                Mnet
                Asian Music Awards. While the group was on a break in early 2009, members pursued solo activities.</p><p>They
                reunited to
                collaborate with 2NE1, their label's new girl group who had been dubbed as "The Female Big Bang" at the
                time. Kicking off the new year with the 2010 Big Show concert at Olympics Gymnastics Arena, Big Bang
                flew to
                Japan to embark
                on their Electric Love Tour. Their third Japanese studio album, Big Bang 2 (2011) was preceded with
                three
                singles: "Let Me Hear Your Voice", "Tell Me Goodbye", and "Beautiful
                Hangover".
            For most of the year, members individually promoted their own
                work, including the introduction of the sub-unit GD & TOP with their collaboration album. After nearly
                two-year
                hiatus as a full group, Big Bang returned to South Korea with their 2011 Big Show concert, showcasing
                songs
                from the upcoming EP Tonight.</p>

            <h1>Alive, Still Alive, M.A.D.E</h1>
            <p>In January 2012, YG Entertainment began releasing teasers for Big Bang's fifth
                Korean EP Alive. The album was generally well received and praised for
                showcasing the group's "progress, musical variety, and non-conformity" while "still maintaining Big
                Bang's
                unique identity"
                Three singles were released to promote the album: "Blue", the lead single, and the second single "Bad Boy"
                , also the last,
                "Fantastic Baby".
                Following the success of their comeback, Big Bang released a special edition album titled Still Alive on
                June 3. It featured
                four new tracks including two new Korean tracks of which their lead single was titled "Monster". Following the success of their comeback, Big Bang released a special edition
                album
                titled Still Alive on June 3. It featured four new tracks including two new Korean tracks of which their
                lead single was titled "Monster",
                as well as Korean remakes of the two additional tracks in the Japanese version of Alive. Big Bang reunited in November 2013 for their Japan Dome
                Tour,
                holding concerts in six different
                dome arenas in Japan, being the first foreign act to do so.
            </p>
            <p>Big Bang was on hiatus for two years while G-Dragon experienced a "career
                slump"
                and was unable to find inspiration to write new music for the band, explaining that "In the past, even
                after coming back from a long, tiring day, I would write at least two songs at the dorm before I slept
                as if
                it were my duty. In 2014, however, things just weren't working out for me so the album kept getting
                delayed." In 2015,
                Big Bang made their comeback by releasing special project singles for their album Made: M, A, D, and E.
                The
                first single, M, released in May, included the two songs "Loser" and "Bae Bae"
                The following month saw the release of A, which included "Bang Bang Bang" and "We Like 2 Party". "Bang Bang Bang" won Song of the
                Year
                at the 17th Mnet Asian Music Awards, and was the best-performing single of 2015 in South Korea according
                to
                the Gaon
                Digital Chart. D was released in July and included "Sober" and "If You". "If You". The consecutive monthly releases concluded with E in August, with the songs "Zutter", featuring
                the
                sub-unit of GD & TOP, and "Let's Not Fall in Love".</p>

            <h1>Military Enlistment, Seungri's Retirement</h1>
            <p>Despite the commercial success of the singles, the release of the full album
                was
                postponed to add new songs to the album and for the group to rest after four months of promotions.
                Big Bang continued touring into 2016 for their Made V.I.P Tour, visiting China, Macau, Malaysia,
                Singapore,
                Taiwan and the United States. Several projects were launched to commemorate the group's 10th
                anniversary.
                The first was
                the documentary film Big Bang Made, which followed the group through their Made Tour in 2015, released
                on
                June 30, 2016. After a year of delay, Made was released in December 2016. Two singles were announced for
                the
                release: "Fxxk It"
                , and "Last Dance". The two songs, along with "Girlfriend", took the three top places on the Gaon
                Digital
                Chart, selling over one million digital copies combined in five days. As per South Korea's mandatory
                military service requirement,
                T.O.P. enlisted for his two-year service on February 9, 2017 as a conscripted policeman. The remaining
                members continued promotions without him. In 2017, YG Entertainment released a reality program starring
                the
                group named Run,
                Big Bang Scout! through YouTube Red, which was the service's first original content to be produced in a
                country outside of the United States. The first episode of the program was free-released and has
                gathered
                over 12.7 million views
                on YouTube.</p><p>The following year, the remaining members began their enlistment: G-Dragon on February 27,
                Taeyang on March 12, and Daesung on March 13, 2018. Seungri will enlist on March 25, 2019. The single,
                "Flower Road", was
                released on March 13, 2018 as a goodbye to their fans. "Flower Road" set a record in China, reaching
                over a
                million sales in 3 days and 14 hours, the shortest amount of time for a Korean artist. The song also
                topped
                Billboard's
                World Digital Songs Chart, and the Gaon Digital Chart, where the song recorded the highest digital index
                of
                the year thus far. On March 11, 2019, Seungri announced his retirement from the entertainment industry
                due
                to scandals
                surrounding the Burning Sun nightclub, resulting in his departure from Big Bang.</p>
