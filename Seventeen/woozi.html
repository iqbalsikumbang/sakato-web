      <p style="text-indent:0;"> 
      – Woozi was supposed to be in the performance team, but since he’s making songs he got into vocal team.<br>
      – Woozi never had a girlfriend. (As of 2017)<br>
      – He was voted by the other members as the most hard working member, along with Soonyoung.<br>
      – He views himself as being very calm, serious and careful.<br>
      – DK has chosen him as the member he was awkward with before, so Woozi started calling him Dokyeom-shi
      (formal).<br>
      – His hobby is enjoying music.<br>
      – His favorite food is Jjajangmyun (Black Bean Noodles) & Spicy Ramyun Noodles mix together.<br>
      – He can’t eat really spicy food.<br>
      – He likes sports.<br>
      – He likes dogs.<br>
      – He’s a fan of the X-Men series. He likes watching films with Hugh Jackman in them.<br>
      – Between Winter or Summer, he prefers Winter.<br>
      – He was in Hello Venus’ “Venus” MV, NU’EST’s “Face” MV, and Orange Caramel’s “My Copycat” MV<br>
      – His role models are Chris Brown and Park Jin Young.<br>
      – S.Coups felt sorry for Woozi because he felt like Woozi was more of a leader than he is, because Woozi is the
      one who makes Seventeen work.<br>
      – He probably seems shy and blunt, but he has profound emotion, and once he becomes close to someone, such a
      close relationship will continue forever. (Japanese Seventeen Magazine)<br>
      – He is the album producer. He decides the concept, makes the songs, writes the lyrics, and thinks about what
      order they should go in. Seventeen’s musical composition is worked on by all the members, but about 80% of it is
      done by him. It makes him happier than anything when fans says their songs are good. (Japanese Seventeen
      Magazine)<br></p>
