      <p>According to <strong>Dispatch</strong>, Lee contacted Han on 1 June 2016, requesting to speak to her
        on the phone. Han told Dispatch what transpired during
        the phone call and it is reportedly as follows: <strong>"He said that B.I got caught [during internal drug tests]. [B.I]
        told them that he did drugs with me. [Lee Seung-Hoon]
        asked me to meet up with him urgently. And then I went to a location near the YG building."</strong> However, instead of
        Lee, another person referred to as <strong>"K"</strong> met Han, telling
        her to keep the issue regarding B.I a secret. On 22 August 2016, <strong>"K"</strong> reportedly found out that Han had told the
        police about B.I after she was interrogated for her drug
        charges. The next day, "K" picked Han up from her home and drove her to the YG Entertainment building. According
        to Han, she was escorted to Yang Hyun-Suk's office where
        she had to surrender her phone. Han claimed that the conversation with Yang lasted one and a half hours, whereby
        <strong>the CEO had allegedly threatened her if she did not change
        her previous statement to the police</strong>. Dispatch received statements from both Yang Hyun-Suk and Han Seo-Hee
        regarding the conversation between them and it is as follows:
        In his account, Yang Hyun-Suk stated, <strong>"It's true that I took her cell phone. In case she tried to record. And
        even then, I was very careful with my words. I told her that
        we run the drug tests twice a month, and that Han Bin has never once tested positive. I told her that if Han Bin
        ends up going to the police and if he doesn't test positive,
        then she could be charged for lying, deceit, and defamation of character. That's when she got scared and she
        chose to take back her previous statements herself. If he went to
        the police then? He would have tested negative right away."</strong>Han Seo-Hee's recounted in her statement, <strong>"Yang
        Hyun-Suk took my cell phone and turned it off. He asked me what happened
        at the police. I told him that I confessed to B.I smoking marijuana with me, and buying LSD through me. Yang
        Hyun -uk replied, 'I hate even the idea of my boys being investigated by
        the police.' He also told me that they got rid of all of the drug traces from [B.I's] body, so there would be no
        way for him to test positive... I remember him also saying, 'Seo-Hee!
        You need to become a nicer child. You can't become a bad child, right... Your dream is to become a singer? Then
        you need to stay in the entertainment industry. But it would be a piece
        of cake for me to ruin you... He told me to take back my previous comments to the police.</strong><img

      <p><strong>He said that he can access all of the police reports, and also that he would hire a lawyer
        for me with the fees paid. I was scared, and I didn't have a choice."</strong> According to KBS, the police did file a
        separate investigative report on the drug allegations against B.I and had
        forwarded the case to the prosecutor's office, where the prosecution that took no further action. When reporters
        asked why this was the case, the prosecutors replied, <strong>"Han Seo-Hee was
        crying so much at the time of the investigation that we could not conduct the investigation properly."</strong> Han was
        reportedly only summoned once by the prosecutors at that time. The police
        stated to the press that Han is a key witness and is required to be present for them to verify the validity of
        the alleged text messages between her and B.I. Furthermore, the police
        would need to get an official testimony regarding what happened when she met with Yang Hyun-Suk. <strong>"We have to
        collect Han's statements and collect relevant evidence, but we cannot
        wait to see if Han will sincerely cooperate,"</strong> a representative from the police said. If Han does not return to
        Seoul, the police will summon B.I this week to gather his statements first.
      </p>
      <p> <strong>Commissioner General Min Gap-Ryong of the Korean National Police Agency</strong> held a
        press conference to address the drug controversies that are surrounding
        YG Entertainment. The Commissioner General stated, <strong>"We will thoroughly investigate the suspicions that were
        raised by forming an exclusive team that will be headed by the director
        of the detective division at Gyeonggi Southern Provincial Police Agency. We learned a lesson while investigating
        Burning Sun. By fully utilizing the knowledge we gained through
        previous drug cases and other similar cases, we will conduct an exhaustive investigation to resolve all of the
        suspicions raised by the public."</strong> South Korean news broadcast station,
        KBS 1TV's News 9 reported that the Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission has forwarded B.I's drug
        allegations and the YG Entertainment cover-up allegations to the Supreme Public
        Prosecutors' Office. <strong>"There were three main things in the report sent to the Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights
        Commission at the beginning of this month: B.I's drug use charges,
        suspicion of corruption between Yang Hyun-Suk and the investigation office, and YG Entertainment's systematic
        concealment of offenders."</strong> It looks like the key will be whether or not YG
        and Yang Hyun-Suk actually covered up or interfered with the investigation of its agency's artists.," KBS
        reported. Han Seo-Hee revealed on her Instagram story that she has returned to
        Seoul from Japan. She has yet to clarify why she had to take a detour to Japan first before arriving in South
        Korea. During the interview in Lee Kyu-Yeon's Spotlight, Han revealed a YG employee named Mr Kim, who
        was reportedly in charge of these monthly drug tests. Mr. K always carried around a drug test kit with him. It
        was a big case but if you test your urine, it shows you what drugs you've taken.
        They needed to test you so that they can flush it out if you test positive," Han said. She went on to state that
        Big Bang was allegedly exempted from these tests. However, members of iKON
        and WINNER were tested, especially back in 2016 when the groups were still rookies. <strong>"That's when B.I tested
        positive for marijuana,"</strong> Han explained. </p>
