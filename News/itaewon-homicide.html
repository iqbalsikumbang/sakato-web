        <strong>The Itaewon Burger King Murder</strong> took place on April 3, 1997 when
        22-year-old Hongik University student <strong>Jo Jung-pil</strong>, born 1974 was
        stabbed to death at Burger King in Itaewon. <strong>Arthur Patterson</strong>, 18 at
        the time of the incident (born to an American father and a South
        Korean mother) is the main suspect. Edward Lee and Arthur Patterson
        with 20 other male (mostly Korean-American youths) and female
        teenagers were hanging out on the 4th floor of a building in Itaewon
        on April 3, 1997. Patterson and his friend Lee went to the bathroom,
        where they <strong>coincidentally came in contact with Jo Jung-Pil and stabbed
          him 9 times in the carotid artery using the knife.</strong>.</p><p> The case had been investigated by <strong>Army
          CID</strong>, who gathered enough
        evidence to prosecute Patterson. As the <strong>South Korean investigators
          could not speak English</strong>, they also had problems interrogating which
        slowed down their initial investigation. <strong>Both Patterson and Lee also
          claimed that the other person committed the actual murder</strong>. Also,
        people found it very suspicious that the crime scene was cleaned
        spotless after only two days, which is very unusual. In addition, the
        <strong>Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA)</strong> caused problems in finding witnesses
        and investigation. Lee
        was convicted of murder while Patterson was convicted of possession of
        weapon.

        After the first trial for the murder, it was ruled that Lee
        was guilty of murder. Lee was later acquitted by the <strong>Supreme Court of
          South Korea</strong> because of insufficient evidence.<img src="../img/news/itwhmcd1.jpg" style="

            " /> Patterson was
        convicted for possession of weapons and abandoned his appeal but was
        released from prison after his sentence was stopped. In the midst of
        this, the Ministry of Justice (Republic of Korea) did not extend the
        foreign travel ban for Patterson, <strong>three days before the foreign travel
          ban begun he decided to depart to the United States making further
          investigation difficult.</strong> The family of Jo Jong-pil claimed damages
        against the country for being negligent during the first and second
        trial.</p><p> The Supreme Court of Korea ruled that <i>"the relationship between
          the negligence of the prosecutor and the bereaved families of the
          mentally damage is recognized"</i>. <strong>Prosecution of Patterson was requested
          by Jo Jong-pil's family, after the film The Case of Itaewon Homicide
          was released,</strong> due to high public demand, another judgement had to be
        made. The prosecutors at the Department of Justice petitioned for
        extradition on December 15, 2009.
        
      </p>
      <h1>Sentenced</h1>
      <p>
        18 years after the crime, in September 2015, Patterson was extradited
        to Seoul to stand trial for the murder. <strong>Patterson continued to claim
          his innocence throughout the trial</strong>, maintaining that Lee was the
        killer. In January 2016, <strong>Patterson was found guilty and sentenced
          to 20 years in prison</strong>, with the judge explaining that <i>"the court
          decided on a life sentence, but in view of the defendant's age, of
          being under 18 at the time, the sentence will be 20 years in prison."</i>
