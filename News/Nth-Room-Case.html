          In February 2019, the fact that there was a Telegram chatroom where
          the
          <strong

            sexual exploitation, even sharing personal information</strong
          >, known to public. It became known on popular South Korean, male
          dominant online communities such as Ilbe Storage(Ilbe) and the erotic
          gallery and study gallery of dcinside.</p><p> Someone with the nickname
          <strong>"God God"</strong> created the "1st room" up to the "8th room"
          (nicknamed "nth room"), and uploaded pornography of sexual
          exploitation. Someone with the nickname
          <strong>"watchman"</strong> uploaded that link and allowed it to be
          accessed in a Telegram room called <strong>"Gotham room."</strong>
          However nth room disappeared in September 2019, and other rooms
          appeared instead. It is true that Nth room started first and
          the place where the crime was conducted is the Doctor's room. One
          shocking fact is that
          <strong>16 of the officially known victims were minors,</strong>
          including middle school students along with the fact that there are
          30,000 paid members who traded those videos.</p><p> In Doctor's room,
          <strong
            >sexual exploitative pornography was distributed via a Telegram
            chatroom, and was only accessible by crypto-currency
            payment.</strong
          >
          <strong>"Doctor"</strong>, who appeared in July 2019, threatened
          women, and took sadistic pictures and videos by figuring out their
          personal information, and then uploaded these pictures and videos. In addition, a high
          school student in Incheon was running various Telegram chatting rooms
          that
          <strong
            >distributed child pornography and links for buying drugs, and even
            shared tricks for dealing with police investigations.</strong

            contacting 112</strong

            Room</strong

          but his accomplice and Telegram users who share these videos trade for
          money are still unknown. Over 2 million have signed a national
          petition requesting the South Korean government to disclose the
          identity of users who have shared in the chatroom. On March 25, 2020
          Korean virtual and crypto-currency operators agreed to cooperate with
          authorities in connection with this case, by determining that the
          leaders and subscribers of nth room paid with virtual currency.

          On March 23, 2020, SBS first disclosed the identity of the "Doctor's
          room" suspect. His name is <strong>Cho Joo-bin</strong>, born October
          14, 1995. On March 24th, following a decision of the
          <strong
            >Personal Information Disclosure Review Committee of the Seoul
            Metropolitan Police Agency</strong
          >, an official identity disclosure measure was taken, on the basis of
          <strong
            >Article 25 of the Act on Special Cases Concerning the Punishment of
            Sexual Crimes</strong
          >.</p><p> It is also suspected that he was active as a ilbe member, although
          this has not been confirmed. Meanwhile, the user with the nickname
          <strong>"watchman"</strong> who was known as the mastermind and the
          individual who made Nth Room popular was arrested in September 2019.
          He was revealed as
          <strong>Mr. Jeon, a 38 year-old company worker</strong>, who had
          received a suspended sentence for pornography distribution in the
          past. Mr. Jeon was indicted on
          <strong
            >suspicion of operating an Internet site featuring illegal
            recordings</strong
          >, and a sentence of imprisonment of 3 years 6 months was sought by
          the prosecution. However, since it was revealed during the trial that
          there is a connection with nth room, an application is underway for
          resumption of hearings. <strong>Mr. Shin</strong>, the prior operator
          of Nth Room, who had inherited it from "God God" was a male in his
          30s, who had previously received a suspended sentence for violating
          the Act on the Protection of Children and Youth Against Sex Offenses,
          and was taken into police custody in September 2019.
