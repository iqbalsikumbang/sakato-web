      <h1>FROG BOYS</h1>
      <img src="../img/news/frogboys.png" style="float:right;opacity:.8;width:40vw;height:40vh;margin:10px;">
      <p> <strong>The Frog Boys</strong> (Korean: 개구리소년 Gaegurisonyeon) is a <strong>group of five murdered South Korean boys who disappeared on
        March 26, 1991, in West of Daegu while frog-hunting</strong>. Their bodies were found 11 years later. The incident has
        been the subject of two
        films: Come Back, Frog Boys (1992) and Children (2011). There are also several songs referencing the case.</p>
      <p><strong>U Cheol-won (13), Jo Ho-yeon (12), Kim Yeong-gyu (11), Park Chan-in (10), and Kim Jong-sik (9)</strong> went to catch
        frogs near Mount Waryong,
        South Korea, on March 26, 1991. It was a national holiday so they didn’t have to go to schools. <i>They never
        returned home. Their remains were found in 2002.</i>
        A massive manhunt followed after the boys didn’t come home. National newscasts kept the country up to date.
        Volunteers joined police to help find the boys.
        <i>The area where they said they would go, Mount Waryong, was searched many times. And yet it is exactly there that
        they were found</i>. The children found were in an
        area they knew well. They were only 3.5 kilometers away from their homes.
        <p>On Mount Waryong, two men stumbled on human remains. Wikipedia mentioned that people searched the area
          hundreds of times however, the link under footnote #6
          no longer works. I do believe the authorities searched that area many times. That is where the boys said they
          would be. Is it possible to still find remains then?
          Yes. Soil shifts.</p>

  <div id="slide2" style="background-image: url(../img/news/fb.png)" class="slide">
    <div class="title">
      <p>Earth tremors can open up and cover areas. And, their remains could have been planted there after all the
        searches were discontinued. My main concern
        is that we cannot prove that the boys were murdered exactly where they were found. We cannot prove that their
        remains were not hidden somewhere else first. We cannot
        even prove that they were killed all at once in one violent sessions without a cooling down period or, that they
        were killed one by one. The latter version begs the question
        of the number of people involved to keep the boys under their control. The children’s clothes were tied in
        knots.</p><img src="../img/news/fb.png" style="float:right;margin:10px;opacity:.9;width:30vw;height:40vh;"><p> Whether
        their bodily extremities were tied I could not find.
        I also wonder why their bodies were reunited in death. They were found tied up (I’d like to know how exactly)
        and placed in a huddling position. Maybe to mislead police? The
        huddling position did make them think at first that the boys got lost and died together of hypothermia/exposure.
        But placing them together could also have been a twisted act of
        humanity. A sort of regret after cool down on the part of their killer(s). The five boys were buried on March
        25, 2004. <strong>Their families donated their skulls to medical science
        for research</strong> and maybe too in hopes to find out more about the trauma to their children’s skulls.</p>
      <h1>Murder</h1>
      <p><strong>Experts found two bullet holes in one child’s skull. Three from the five skulls had blunt-force trauma.</strong> It is
        possible that they were hit unconscious with an object like a tool.
        What kind of object/tool, who wielded it, and why that is the mystery. <i>“The three skulls were caved in and
        showed a number of sharp cracks and holes, the investigators said.”</i>
        That means the cause of death could be cranial injuries. Police found a 5cm long loaded shell and two 1cm long
        empty shells near the scene. They sent them to a lab to find out
        if they are related to this case. Police did mention there was a shooting practice field not far from the crime
        scene. <i>Some questioned why the boys had taken off their clothes.
        I think it is very hard to have a definitive answer in 2017 whether the boys undressed themselves or whether
        their clothes loosened naturally in time due to deterioration and earth shifting.</i></p>
