      <h1>Hwaseong Serial Murder</h1>
      <p><strong>The Hwaseong Serial Murders</strong> are an unsolved
        serial murder case that occurred in the South Korean city of Hwaseong between September 15, 1986 and April 3,
        1991. <strong>In each case, a woman or girl was
          found bound and murdered. The murders are considered to be the most infamous in the modern history of South
          Korea and have been compared to those of the Zodiac Killer.</strong>
        <strong>In South Korea, statute of limitations for murder is 15 years. So even if the killer is caught after the
          limitation time, can't be charged and punished.</strong> <img src="../img/news/investhwaseong.png"
          style="float:right;opacity:.8;margin:10px;width:40vw;height:40vh;">For this case,
        ran out in April 2, 2006. The files have kept by the police and they said will get to the bottom of this
        regardless of the limit also investigation keep running.
        Material evidence, such as semen samples from victims, hair and cigarette butts, were collected, but all failed
        to pinpoint the identity of the killer.</p>
      <p><strong>It is now legally
        impossible to bring the uncaught killer to justice since the statute of limitations has already passed on the
        case.</strong> According to Kwon, a case turns cold either because it
        was investigated during a time when the nation lacked profiling skills or the investigation process is prolonged
        to prevent wrongful conviction. <strong>“Cases like the Hwaseong
          serial killings went cold because of dated forensic technology,”</strong> said Kwon. The late 1980s and early
        1990s were
        when a sharp shift in crime motivations occurred, as fast
        changes in society and the economy left behind people at the margins of society, but the authorities failed to
        adapt to the times, he noted.</p>

      <p><strong>More than a decade after the
          Hwaseong case, renowned director Bong Joon-ho made a film loosely based on the sequence of events. “Memories
          of
          Murder” (2003)</strong> attracted 5.3 million moviegoers nationwide
        and added more notoriety to the controversial case. <strong>Recent hit South Korean dramas, such as tvN’s
          “Signal” and
          OCN’s “Tunnel,”</strong> have also brought back nauseating memories
        from times when the nation has been shocked by horrendous questions that remain unanswered to this day. Both
        have time traveling as their main plot device, which seems to
        reflect the desire of many to solve cases that remain frozen in time. Recently, cold case teams within police
        departments have been focusing on reopening files that have
        been buried in dust.</p><img src="../img/news/sketchhwaseong.png"
        style="float:right;margin:10px;opacity:.8;width:40vw;height:40vh;">
      <p><strong>Unsolved cases from the early 2000s were
          brought back with the hope of discovering new
          evidence through advanced technology.</strong> Another mysterious rape
        and murder of a 17-year-old girl that happened in South Jeolla Province in 2001, called the “Dedeul River case,”
        is an example of a case that was reopened with successful
        results. Police focused on reanalyzing DNA data extracted from retained semen samples along with new evidence
        found in the archives.</p><p> <strong>A 40-year-old man surnamed Kim, who
          was already serving in prison on charges of robbery and murder, was resentenced to life in prison for his past
          wrongdoing.</strong> Kwon said that it is crucial to keep an open mind
        when reinvestigating a case and recommended minimized exposure to outdated records which can distract one from
        producing fresh theories. <strong>“The original files could hold error
          s which can sidetrack investigators from seeing the truth.”</strong> He added that modern-day cold cases
        sometimes derive
        from complacent attitudes such as the police not taking
        disappearance reports seriously. Kwon also emphasized the importance of patience and heading in the right
        direction when pursuing a reopened cold case. <strong>“Solving a cold case
          is not only about the results, but the process itself,”</strong> said Kwon. <strong>“When a case is finally
          solved after a period
          of stagnation, then there is nothing better than that.”</strong></p>
