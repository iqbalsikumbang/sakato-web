      <p><strong>The Sinking of MV Sewol, also called the Sewol ferry disaster, occurred on
          the morning of 16 April 2014,
          when the passenger/ro-ro ferry was en route from Incheon towards Jeju in South Korea.</strong> The ferry sank
        while
        carrying 476 people, mostly secondary school
        students from Danwon High School (Ansan City). The 6,825-ton vessel sent a distress signal from about 2.7
        kilometres (1.7 mi) north of Byeongpungdo at 08:58
        KST (23:58 UTC, 15 April 2014).</p><p><strong>Total, 304 passengers and crew members died in the disaster. Of the
          approximately 172 survivors,</strong> more than half were rescued
        by fishing boats and other commercial vessels that arrived at the scene approximately 40 minutes after the Korea
        Coast Guard. The sinking of MV Sewol resulted
        in widespread social and political reaction within South Korea. Many criticized the actions of the captain and
        most of the crew. Also criticized were the ferry
        operator and the regulators who oversaw its operations, along with the administration of President Park Geun-hye
        for its disaster response (including the poor
        showing of the coast guard) and attempts to downplay government culpability.</p>
      <p>On 15 May 2014, <strong>the captain and
          three crew members were charged with murder,</strong> while
        the other eleven members of the crew were indicted for abandoning the ship. An arrest warrant was also issued
        for Yoo Byung-eun, the owner of Chonghaejin Marine,
        which operated Sewol, but he could not be found despite a nationwide manhunt. On 22 July 2014, police revealed
        that they had established that a dead man found in
        a field 415 kilometres south of Seoul was Yoo.</p>

      <p><strong>A South Korean court ruled Thursday the government is partially liable for the tragic sinking of the
          Sewol
          ferry four years ago and must compensate families of
          the victims,</strong> according to news agencies. The passenger ferry sank off the southwest coast of South
        Korea in
        April 2014. As the country watched live broadcasts in
        horror, <strong>304 of the almost 500 passengers -- most of them high school students on a field trip to the holiday
        island of Jeju -- drowned.</strong></p><p>South Korea's Yonhap news
        agency reported a Seoul court ruled the state is liable in part, and must compensate 200 million South Korean
        won (US$177,000) to the families of each victim, and
        an additional 40 million won (about $35,200) to the parents of every student who lost their lives. A prior
        investigation into the sinking found evidence of negligence
        by the coast guard and the ship's captain and crew. Survivors said the passengers were told by the Sewol's
        officers to stay put as the vessel sank.</p>
      <p><strong>Lee Joon-seok,
          the captain, was found guilty of murder on appeal and sentenced to life in prison.</strong> The incident was a
        black
        mark on the presidency of Park Geun-hye, who appeared
        to be absent during the unfolding disaster. Park has since been impeached and is facing corruption charges
        unrelated to the Sewol disaster. Thursday was the first time
        a South Korean court acknowledged the government's liability in the tragedy, which involved a botched rescue
        and a structurally unsound ferry, according to Reuters.
        South Korean authorities raised the vessel in March 2017, hoping they could find the the missing remains of
        nine people. One set was found in May that year.</p>
