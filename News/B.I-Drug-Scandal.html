      <h1>B.I Drug Scandal</h1>
      <img src="../img/news/B.Ics.png" class="img-fluid" style="opacity:.9;float:left;width:30vh;height:30vh;margin:10px;">
      <p> <strong>Kim Hanbin or B.I</strong> as we know by his stage name, is now the <strong>former leader of IKON</strong>,
        boygroup under YG Entertainment. Following on an exclusive report by <strong>Dispatch</strong>, states that he was <i>suspected
        of purchasing LSD and Marijuana back in August 2016</i>. The report included Kakaotalk chat logs, after <strong>Miss 'A'</strong>
        was arrested for violating the Drug Control Act. In the chat log, B.I inquired about LSD, asked "A"
        about buying 10 doses at a time, requested a large discount.</p>
      <p>Miss "A" was revealed to be <strong>former YG Entertainment trainee</strong>. In 2017, Miss "A" was
        placed on <i>probation for 4 years for smoking marijuana with BIGBANG‘s T.O.P</i>. Initially, police neither
        confirmed nor denied Miss "A"’s identity, but she has since admitted to her involvement in B.I’s scandal.
        When she was arrested on August 22, 2016, Miss "A" told police that, on May 3, 2016, she had delivered 10 doses
        of
        LSD to a location near B.I’s accommodations at his request. Following these events, a drug dealer known as <strong>”C”</strong>
        was also arrested.
        The police discovered B.I’s name among those who purchased drugs from “C”. After obtaining “C’s” confession,
        police arrested Han Heo See
        and confiscated her cell phone, confirming B.I’s name. Even with this confirmation, police did not summon B.I
        for investigation because
        <img src="../img/news/chatlogsBI.png" style="opacity:.9;float:right;width:30vh;height:30vh;margin:10px;">
        Miss "A" reversed her statement on August 30, 2016, stating that <i>B.I did ask for LSD, but he did not actually
        purchase it</i>. When asked where
        B.I obtained marijuana and smoked it, <i>Miss "A" said she didn’t know</i>. The Yongin Police Department determined
        that the <i>circumstantial evidence
        was not enough to summon B.I for investigations</i>, but a former drug investigator <i>found fault with the police’s
        decision.</i></p>
      <p>Mr. A detailed the methods of delivery and other things in his first statement.
        Also, Kim Han Bin (B.I) stated that he did it with Mr. A. I have
        to question this case. Why did they not investigate just because the suspect changed his statement?

          — Former drug investigator
        YG Entertainment was contacted regarding this case on June 10 and they <strong>denied B.I’s involvement with drug usage</strong>.
        YG Entertainment is <i>strictly managing drug usage for all artists</i>. B.I is not connected to the 2016 drug case.
        YG purchases a simple drug test kit every 2 months from the United States and tests our artists. iKON members
        all received a drug test prior to their promotions.
        <i>Including B.I, none of the members showed any signs of drugs at that time</i>. <br>
        — YG Entertainment
        <strong>B.I</strong> admits to wanting to use drugs, <strong>withdraws from iKON On June 12, 2019</strong> B.I left a message on his Instagram,
        apologizing for his inappropriate actions and explaining
        why he was tempted to purchase drugs in 2016. He also announced his departure from iKON.</p>
      <img src="../img/news/B.Iig.png" style="opacity:.9;float:right;width:30vh;height:30vh;margin:10px;">
      <p>&quot; <i>This is Kim Hanbin.
        First of all, I sincerely apologize for causing trouble with my inappropriate behavior.
        It is true that I had previously wanted to rely on things that I should not have even had interest in because I
        was having such a difficult and rough time.
        But I was not even able to do it because I was afraid.
        Nevertheless, I am extremely embarassed and sorry towards all of our fans and our members, who are deeply
        disappointed and hurt by my wrong words and actions.
        I will humbly reflect upon my wrongdoings and withdraw from the team.
        I sincerely bow my head in apology once again to our fans and our members. I’m sorry.&quot;
        ㅡ B.I</i></p>
      <p>Meanwhile, <strong>YG Entertainment denied Dispatch's accusations</strong> of Yang Hyun-Suk being
        involved in hiring a lawyer for "A" and pressuring "A"
        to alter their testimony. Local news outlet, Newsis reported that "A" had anonymously <i>reported YG Entertainment
        to the Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission</i>
        on grounds of allegedly having ties with the police. This complaint was submitted to the Anti-Corruption and
        Civil Rights Commission on 4 April 2019 via lawyer,
        <strong>Bang Jung-Hyun</strong>. The complaint also stated that Yang Hyun-Suk had threatened "A" to change their testimony. In an
        interview with KBS, Bang stated that Yang had taken
        "A's" phone so that the conversation could not be recorded and proceeded to say, <i>"I hate our artists going to
        the police station for that kind of problem. I'll give
        you sufficient compensation and appoint a lawyer for you, so go to the police station and change all of your
        testimony."</i> When she was interrogated by the police in August 2016,
        she reportedly admitted that <i>she had delivered LSD to B.I on 3 May 2016</i>. However, during her third round of
        interrogations, <i>Han changed her testimony, saying that she had
        not delivered any drugs to B.I at all.</i> </p>
