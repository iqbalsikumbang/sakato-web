          Scandal involving electoral fraud in several
          <strong>reality competition series</strong> produced and broadcast by
          the television channel <strong>Mnet</strong>. The incident primarily
          involves the <strong>Produce 101 series and Idol School</strong>,
          which were intended to create K-pop groups with members selected by
          audience vote. In July 2019, during the final episode the Produce 101
          series' fourth season, Produce X 101, several viewers suspected that
          the
          <strong
            >total votes were manipulated after noticing numerical
            patterns</strong
          >. On August 1, 2019, 272 viewers filed a lawsuit against Mnet, as
          their on-site text voting service charged ₩100 per vote, prompting an
          investigation led by the <strong>Seoul Metropolitan Police</strong>.</p>
          <p>In response to the allegations, Mnet admitted that there were errors
          in calculating, but they also maintained that final rankings were
          correct and had no intention of changing X1's member line-up. 14
          representatives from entertainment agencies of the 20 finalists held a
          meeting on July 29, 2019, and agreed to
          <strong>support Produce X 101's outcome and X1's debut</strong>.
          During their first search, the police uncovered voice recordings of
          the staff members discussing vote manipulation on the previous seasons
          of the show, resulting in them extending their investigation to
          <strong
            >all four seasons of the Produce 101 series, Idol School, Show Me
            the Money, and Superstar K.

          The police issued a search and seizure warrant on the offices of
          <strong
            >Starship Entertainment, Woollim Entertainment, and MBK
            Entertainment</strong
          >. Reportedly, per contract signed with
          <strong>CJ E&M (MNET Agency)</strong>, the entertainment agencies were
          paid ₩100,000 for every episode their talent appeared in. An anonymous
          trainee alleged only ₩1 million was given to their talent agencies for
          participating in a song, while each participant would only get a small
          percentage, and CJ E&M would keep additional profits if the song
          performed well.
          <strong
            >Some entertainment agencies who disagreed would request their
            talents to be eliminated at the last minute to withdraw
            them.</strong

          </p><p>Participants of Produce X 101 and Idol School and agency officials
          alleged anonymously that the production teams were
          <i
            >biased to trainees they preferred, such as forcing song producers
            to give certain trainees more lines and providing them with more
            screen time; one of them alleged that a contestant had his screen
            time completely removed when he had raised a complaint against a
            staff member, who had yelled at him to wake up.</i
          >
          An anonymous trainee alleged that one trainee, under pressure from
          Starship Entertainment, was secretly informed about a mission in
          advance by one of the choreographers. He also alleged that
          <i
            >some trainees knew the final rankings before the results were
            announced, and that a trainee from Woollim Entertainment was told by
            a representative that only one person from their company would debut
            in X1.</i
          >
        </p>
        <h1>Idol School</h1>
        <p>
          On October 3, 2019, a trainee of Idol School alleged anonymously that
          only
          <strong
            >three-to-four trainees, out of 4,000 applicants, had auditioned to
            appear on the show</strong
          >, indicating that the majority of the contestants did not have to go
          through an audition process to compete. In an interview with
          <strong>MBC (TV Channel)</strong>, a trainee alleged that, throughout
          their six-month training period, the contestants were
          <i
            >only given clothes appropriate for the summer and had to wear them
            in cold weather.</i
          ></p><p>
          In addition to that, they were
          <i
            >cut off from outside communication, were only allowed to buy daily
            necessities once a month, and were not given enough food to eat.</i
          >
          During the October 15 broadcast of PD Note, several trainees
          anonymously claimed that their
          <strong
            >living quarters had poor ventilation and some girls developed
            rashes from dust.</strong
          >
          The trainees also claimed that they were so malnourished some of them
          did not menstruate or had periods lasting for two months.

        <h1>Verdict</h1>
        <p>
          On November 5, 2019, after approval from the
          <strong>Seoul National District Court</strong>, the police issued
          arrest warrants and travel bans for director<strong>
            Ahn Joon-young</strong
          >, chief producer<strong> Kim Yong-bum</strong>, a<strong>
            producer with the surname Lee</strong
          >, and Starship Entertainment's vice president<strong>
            Kim Kang-hyo</strong
          >, after they had attempted to destroy evidence. By evening, Ahn and
          Kim Yong-bum were arrested. During questioning, Ahn initially
          <i
            >admitted to having manipulated the rankings for Produce 48 and
            Produce X 101 only,</i
          >
          but he later also admitted to partially manipulating the rankings for
          the first two seasons as well. A total of 10 people, including the
          previously reported four individuals, were arrested on November 12,
          2019. One of the other six people arrested was Shin Hyung-kwan, the
          vice president of CJ ENM.
        </p>
        <p>
          On December 3, 2019,
          <i
            >Ahn, Kim Yong-bum, and Lee were indicted for obstruction of
            business and fraud; executives Kim Shi-dae and Kim from Starship
            Entertainment, former Woollim Entertainment employee Lee, former 8D
            Creative employee Ryu, and Around Us Entertainment employee Kim were
            indicted for bribery and violating the Improper Solicitation and
            Graft Act.</i
          >
          The indictment revealed that Ahn and Kim Yong-bum had met with one
          other professional two days before the live finale of Produce X 101 to
          determine the final 11 members of X1 based on pre-finale online votes
          and had wanted to<strong>
            exclude contestants they did not prefer,</strong
          >
          particularly those who had already debuted in other groups.</p><p> Ahn and
          Kim Yong-bum held a similar meeting in August 2018 before the live
          finale of Produce 48 to choose Iz*One's final 12 members. Ahn swapped
          rankings for one trainee who was supposed to debut in Wanna One. A
          later report mentioned that the indictment also revealed rankings for
          one trainee who was supposed to debut in I.O.I were swapped. Ahn and
          Kim Yong-bum stated in the indictment that they<strong
            >had predetermined the line-up for Iz*One and X1 because they were
            pressured by Wanna One's success.</strong
          >

        />
        <p>
          <strong>CJ ENM had earned ₩124.65 million</strong> from the paid text
          messaging votes from Produce 48 and Produce X 101. Police previously
          found that Ahn had been
          <i
            >using services from adult entertainment establishments in Gangnam
            paid for by various talent agencies approximately 40 times beginning
            from the second half of 2018, estimating to ₩100 million.</i
          >
          The indictment, however, clarified that, from January 2018 to July
          2019, Ahn received services 47 times, estimating ₩46.83 million, that
          were paid for by the five talent agency representatives in exchange
          for giving their trainees favorable screentime. In response to this
          report, 8D Creative stated that Ryu was no longer working for their
          agency and was being indicted for bribery on Produce X 101 through his
          own agency, Enfant Terrible. Around Us Entertainment stated that their
          employee Kim purchased alcohol for Ahn but they were not involved in
          bribery. On February 14, 2020, the Seoul Metropolitan Police issued
          arrest warrants for two people who were on the production staff of
          Idol School.
