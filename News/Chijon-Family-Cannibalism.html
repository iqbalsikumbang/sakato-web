        <h1>The Chijon Family: Rich People Eater</h1>

        <p>
          The Chijon Family is a <strong>Korean Cannibal Gang</strong>, founded in 1993 by <strong>Kim
          Ki-hwan</strong>, a former convict, and six other former prisoners and
          unemployed workers who shared his grudge against the rich. Totalling
          eight in number, with one woman in their group, the gang set out in
          their quest on infliction of harm on the rich. 'Chijon' is a name
          given to the gang by prosecutors working on the case — Kim had
          originally named his gang the Mascan, a supposed Greek word for
          'ambition'
        </p>
        <p>
          The gang was dedicated to the <strong>kidnapping and killing of the rich in
          ways unimaginably gruesome</strong>. The Chijon family as they later came to be
          known would abduct their rich victims and get in touch with their
          families to ask for ransom, and they were always paid. But no matter
          how much these families and loved ones of the victims give away as
          ransom, these victims were never set free. They were rather treated in
          the most disrespectful of ways and finally killed. In one of the
          cases, they were able to extort the lump sum of $100,000.00 from a
          particular victim’s family at that time. Eventually, after collecting
          the huge ransom, they still <strong>killed and ate the victim</strong>.</p><img
          src="../img/news/chijonfamily1.png"
          style="float:right;margin:10px;opacity:.8;width: 30vh;height: 30vh;"
        /> <p>Their belief
          was that eating the flesh dof their victims would give them courage,
          which is why Kim Ki-hwan named their gang Mescan in the first place at
          their formation, which was supposed to be for them, a Greek word that
          meant courage. A point came when they decided they needed to be very
          sure they would make any mistakes in their abductions. By this time
          they had had a series of successful operations and collected a number
          of ransoms and had become more bold and daring. They had become the
          <strong>rich’s undeserved nemesis in Seoul, South Korea</strong>.

          So the Chijon family were able to secure the Hyundai garage’s mailing
          list through a disgruntled and begrudged staff of the company who had
          sold out the comprehensive list to them. It wasn’t certain that the
          staff knew exactly what the list was gong to be used for in the hands
          of Kim Ki-hwan and his gang. But he gave it to them anyways. <strong>The
          Hyundai garage Seoul, Korea</strong>, was a place for the elites and the
          society’s richest and there was no more potent lethal tool to perfect
          the execution of their gory plans but the list in their hands. Hunting
          their prey among the rich who patronized Hyundai garage store became
          very easy for them, and so their evil acts once more prevailed. This
          was because the list was an open collection of their perfect targets.
          On the list were about <strong>1,200 names of the most active patrons of the
          Hyundai garage store</strong>.</p><p>These customers were topping the chart for those
          who used credit cards for their purchases. They became sitting ducks
          for Kim Ki-hwan and his gang. And so they continued with their
          unpopular trade, <strong>collecting ransoms, kidnapping, torturing,
          slaughtering, maiming, killing of their victims and of course in
          eating their flesh</strong>. Their ignominious deeds also included rape. It
          would be noted that in their cabin, they had an incinerator. This they
          used in burning and cremating their victims. It is not clear from the
          eventual documentation of the case if they had at any time burnt any
          of their victims in the incinerator. But it aided them to keep their
          tracks protected for every trace of remnant of bodies, corpses and
          incriminating effects were readily burnt to ashes in the incinerator.
        </p>
        <img
          src="../img/news/chijonfamily2.png"
          style="float:right;margin:10px;opacity:.9;width: 40vh;height: 40vh;"
        />
        <p>
          In September 1994, the Chijon family abducted a woman who was taken to
          their infamous cabin for the same gruesome fate. First of all she was
          viciously gang raped by the gang and forced to undergo a load of
          experiences that brought her emotional trauma. She was forced to shoot
          another kidnapped victim in the head, made to hold another while she
          was killed by suffocation with a plastic bag. According to her, this
          woman eventually escaped by an act that was beyond sheer luck,
          somewhat close to a miracle. I believe it was this woman who escaped
          their inevitable death delivery that opened the can of worms
          concerning atrocious perpetrations of the infamous gang and they were
          subsequent rounded up and arrested, and <strong>sentenced to court for trial
          and eventual conviction</strong>.
        </p>
        <h1>The Verdict</h1>
        <img
          src="../img/news/chijonfamily3.png"
          style="float:left;margin:10px;width: 40vh;height: 40vh;"
        />
        <p>
          On the first of November 1994, they were found guilty of murder, of
          burying a number of their victim’s bodies on the hillsides, and
          sentenced to death for the murder of five people. During their
          sessions of interrogation, one member admitted the fact that he ate a
          victim’s flesh after having dismembered them. Of course he would not
          be the only one among the gang that practised cannibalism. However, in
          all their trials and in their subsequent conviction, the Chijon Family
          gang members never showed remorse for their atrocities and crime. They
          were brazen and made unrepentant statements with impunity. The family
          of serial killers summarily had just one regret; <i>not having killed
          more victims and not having eaten more human flesh. That to them,
          would have given them more satisfaction and fulfilment than any other
          thing possible could have</i>.
