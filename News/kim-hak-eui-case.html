        <p>
          Refers to a <strong>video of an orgy that took place in 2009</strong>,
          the exact time is unknown, which
          <strong>former Deputy Justice Minister Kim Hak Eui</strong>
          participated in. Initially it was a sexual bribery case case but it
          turns out that rape and drugging is involved. The video emerge in
          March 2013 when he had recently been appointed to Deputy Justice
          Minister. In the video
          <strong
            >Kim and other high-level officials having a sex party in the
            Gangwon province,</strong
          >
          then confirmed by the police, causing him to resign almost
          immediately. When the case had been sent to prosecutor's office,
          <strong
            >he was cleared because the office claimed that its
            unidentifiable.</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Several years pass and the case is reopened in April 2018. The
          <strong>commission established to carry out the investigation</strong>
          has been investigating the prosecutor’s office who cleared Kim Hak Eui
          twice despite the victim and police successfully identifying Kim in
          the video. They are also investigating police who omitted evidence
          when passing the case to the prosecutor’s office.1,033 civic groups including Korea Women’s HotLine and People’s
          Solidarity for Participatory Democracy held a protest at Gwanghwamun
          in Seoul on Friday,
          <strong
            >urging the Ministry of Justice to extend the investigation period
            and probe Kim’s allegations thoroughly.</strong
          >
          Later in March 2019, A woman only known as ‘Lee’ appeared on a KBS
          news program and levelled accusations against Kim Hak Eui and another
          man named ‘Yoon’.

    <div

    >
      <div class="title">
        <p>
           She says that
          <strong
            >Kim Hak Eui and Yoon repeatedly raped her while Yoon forced her to
            take drugs and made threats.</strong
          >
          She claims there are 30 more victims of the pair but could not
          elaborate because of the
          <strong>potential ‘great repercussions’.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >“The biggest reason (why I agreed to the interview) is that the
            truth must be revealed,”</i
          >
          Lee said,
          <i
            >“I found that the truth is being repeatedly covered, so I wanted to
            provide support (to revealing the case.)”</i
          >
          Lee originally made her accusations in 2014 but the prosecutor’s
          office waved her statements away saying that it was (again) impossible
          to identify her in the video. Lee says they
          <strong
            >ignored her testimony and humiliated her by asking her to repeat
            the actions she performed in the video.</strong
          >
        </p>
        <h1>Authority Problem</h1>
        <p>
          <strong
            >The investigation period is due to end at the end of March</strong
          >
          but investigators are requesting an extension to continue their work.
          The commission is reluctant to do so as the deadline for the case has
          already been extended three times. The statute of limitations for
          “receiving favours”, which is what the case is currently classed as is
          7 years.
          <strong
            >If the case is upgraded to a rape case then the statute of
            limitations is much longer.</strong
          >
          Kim Hak Eui was called into the Seoul Eastern District Prosecutor’s
          Office for questioning on Friday but he didn’t show up. The commission
          does not have the power to force him to attend an interrogation
          because they <strong>lack that authority.</strong>
