      <h1>Biggest Fraud Case in South Korea</h1>
      <img src="../img/news/choheepal.png"
        style="opacity:.8;width:25vw;float:left;height:40vh;margin:10px;">
      <p><strong>58-year-old established a medical equipment supply company and ran 10 leasing branches to lure potential
        investors with
        false promises of high returns on their capital between 2004 and 2008.</strong> Amid the burgeoning probe into the
        pyramid scam, Cho and his aides fled to
        China in 2008. <i> 2012, the South Korean police announced that he had died of a heart attack while being taken
        to a hospital from a hotel in Qingdao, China.</i>
        But doubts have lingered over his death, with victims claiming that Cho faked his own death to dodge the police
        probe and public scrutiny.</p>      
      <p> Fresh testimony, revealed by a local media outlet Tuesday, raised the <strong>possibility that his death was
        fabricated.</strong> A 47-year-old man claiming to have been a key
        aide to Cho said that he had talked to him over the phone several times, the last time being in late 2013. The
        man, <strong>surnamed Choi, served an eight-month jail term
        on charges of hiding Cho,</strong> but moved to China with the fugitive. According to his testimony, Cho underwent
        plastic surgery to change his face upon arriving in China.
        He also allegedly tried to remove his fingerprints, though that was unsuccessful.

    <div class="title">
      <p>Cho also reportedly has
      several girlfriends in Korea delivering money for him to
      live in China. He allegedly carries a handgun in his pocket at all times and spends most of his time playing
      golf and drinking alcohol. Cho is claimed to have lived
      in Yantai, just one and a half hour’s flight from Incheon, <strong>disguised as 53-year-old Korean-Chinese Cho
      Young-bok, or Cao Yongfu, since 2008. His death was backed by
      several pieces of evidence, such as a death certificate issued by Chinese authorities, medical records written
      by Chinese doctors and video footage of his funeral
      service in China</strong>.<img src="../img/news/scam.png" style="float:right;margin:10px;opacity:.9;width:25vw;height:40vh;"
      > But victims argued that Cho might have bribed Chinese government officials to obtain falsified
      documents to prove his death. They also questioned
      the videotape, as it is rare to record funerals in Korea.</p><p> <i>There have also been speculations that the police
      hastily announced Cho’s death without confirming the facts
      at the time to defend senior prosecutors and police officers involved in the fraud case.</i> So far, six senior
      police officials and prosecutors were convicted of accepting
      kickbacks from Cho in return for leniency in the investigations into his fraud scheme. With Kang’s return, the
      prosecution is expected to speed up the probe into whether
      Cho is still alive, his hidden assets and alleged big-scale collusion between investigators and Cho. <strong>Kang
      Tae-yong, Cho’s No. 2 man in the pyramid scheme,</strong> was apprehended
      by the Chinese police at his residence in Jinangsu Province on Saturday, seven years after he escaped to China.
      He allegedly took charge of the company’s finances
      and lobbying investigators. Kang is expected to be extradited to Korea as early as this weekend. As the suspect
      might keep mum about Cho, the prosecution plans to focus
      on tracing Cho’s false bank accounts and flow of his assets. It has already found 120 billion won under Cho’s
      false bank accounts.</p>
