          <strong>Shincheonji Church of Jesus or simply Shincheonji (New Heaven and New
          Earth)</strong> is a Christian new religious movement established on 14 March
          1984 in South Korea by Lee Man-hee. The sect is known for its
          secretive nature; adherents believe that the group's founder Lee Man Hee is
          the returned Jesus Christ and that the Holy Bible is written in secret
          metaphors which only Lee can correctly interpret.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sect became involved in controversy during the 2019–20 coronavirus
          pandemic, an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infections followed from the
          participation of a SARS-CoV-2 infected person, <strong>"Patient 31"</strong>, at the
          organization. A dozen Chinese members of the sect from Wuhan were also
          connected to the Daegu Shincheonji outbreak.
          <img
            src="../img/news/shincheonji1.jpg"
            style="float:right;margin:10px;opacity:.9;width:30vh;height:30vh;"
          />By 20 February 2020, 53 new cases were Shincheonji attendees or
          their families, reaching over 300 by 23 February, over half of all
          cases in South Korea. With an additional 4,000 cases of COVID-19
          within two weeks, and roughly 60% of the total infections nationwide
          having stemmed from the church, the Seoul city government asked
          prosecutors to press charges against the religious group's founder and
          senior members for murder, causing harm, and for violating the
          <strong>Infectious Disease and Control Act</strong>. Interviews have occurred with all
          230,000 members of the religious group and nearly 9,000 were said to
          be showing symptoms of the virus.</p>

        />
         <p>After a 
          <strong>lawsuit was started by the Mayor of Seoul</strong>, the police raided the church premises to check whether
          the list of members supplied by Shincheonji pursuant to a request by
          the authorities was, as the Mayor argued, not complete. The
          authorities checked the list seized during the raid with the one
          Shincheonji had supplied, and concluded that discrepancies were minor.
          In March 2020, the <strong>United States Commission on International Religious
            Freedom (USCIRF)</strong> expressed concern that religious freedom rights of
          Shincheonji members may be violated in South Korea by "exaggerating
          the church's role in the outbreak," and stated that, "<strong>USCIRF</strong> has
          received reports of individuals encountering discrimination at work
          and spousal abuse because of their affiliation with the church."
        </p>
        <h1>Several Controversies</h1>
        <p>
          The sect has been accused of actively infiltrating other churches to
          convert other churches' members.</p>
              <ul><li><p>*<strong>Korea</strong> – Its members have been sighted in <strong>Myeongdong Cathedral</strong>,
          often pretending to be pious believers seeking to lure other Koreans
          or foreigners into their own religious meetings.</p></li>
          <li><p>*<strong>United Kingdom</strong> – In November 2016, <strong>the Church of England</strong> issued a
          formal alert to around 500 parishes in London about the activities of
          a Shincheonji affiliate known as <strong>Parachristo<strong>. Parachristo, a
          registered charity in the UK, runs Bible study courses in London
          Docklands, and was using these courses to recruit members of the
          Church of England. "Those who become involved [in Shincheonji]
          gradually withdraw from friends and family and actively lie about
          their real lives."</p></li>
          <li><p>*<strong>India</strong> – In August 2019, the <strong>Baptist Convention in Manipur, India</strong>,
          warned worshippers to be wary of Shincheonji. <strong>"Their leader Lee
          Man-Hee claims to have access to secret knowledge of scriptures which
          other church pastors do not know.</strong> Moreover, he claims that one can
          truly know God only by following and listening to the teachings of
          Shincheonji.</p></li></ul>
