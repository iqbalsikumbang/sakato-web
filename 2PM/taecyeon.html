        <h2>~~~Profile of TAECYEON 2PM~~~</h2>
        <p>
          Taecyeon was born in Seoul, South Korea, but immigrated at the age of
          10, with his parents and older sister Jihyen to Bedford,
          Massachusetts, a small town situated in the Greater Boston Area. It
          was his sister Jihyen who persuaded him to participate in a JYP
          Entertainment audition, whose promotion she had noticed when surfing
          on the Internet. In 2008 he took part in Mnet's Hot Blood Men which
          follows the extreme training of 13 trainees in order to become a
          member of the boy band One Day. One Day spawned two boy bands, 2AM and
          2PM, the latter of which Taecyeon became a member of. Six months after
          Hot Blood was aired on TV 2PM debuted with their first single "10
          Points out of 10 Points" from their first EP Hottest Time of the Day,
          but it wasn't until their second EP 2:00PM Time For Change that their
          success in the Korean music industry skyrocketed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Taecyeon was featured in Baek Ji-young's 2009 hit song "My Ear's
          Candy".In 2014, he starred in KBS' weekend drama Wonderful Days,
          playing a tough-fisted bodyguard. The same year, he joined tvN's
          cooking variety show Three Meals a Day directed by Na PD. He later
          rejoined for a second season in 2015. Taecyeon was praised for his
          hardworking image and easygoing personality on the show. In 2015,
          Taecyeon was cast in KBS' political drama Assembly. He plays an
          aspiring police officer who studies at the library to pass his
          entrance exams by day and works as an official’s chauffeur by night.
          In 2016, he starred in horror comedy Hey Ghost, Let's Fight with Kim
          So-hyun, and featured in web-drama First Seven Kisses by Lotte Duty
          Free. Taecyeon released his first solo Japanese album Taecyeon
          Special: Winter Hitori in 2017. As part of the solo project, he
          successfully held his first solo concert, 'Taecyeon (From 2PM) Premium
          Concert' at the Tokyo Dome City Hall in Japan on January 2 and 3. In
          July 2018, it was announced that Taecyeon had signed an exclusive
          contract with 51K, an agency founded by actor So Ji-sub, following the
          end of his contract with JYP Entertainment. His former agency reported
          that he will remain as a member of 2PM despite the move.
