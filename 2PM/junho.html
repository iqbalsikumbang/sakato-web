        <h2>~~~Profile of JUNHO 2PM~~~</h2>
        <p>
          Lee Jun-ho born January 25, 1990 in Ilsan-gu, Goyang, South Korea.
          Junho first gained public attention when he won Superstar Survival in
          2006. The show started with twelve teenage competitors and, as the
          weeks went on, they were eliminated one by one until three were left.
          The process followed a similar style to that of reality show Survivor.
          Junho signed a contract with JYP Entertainment after winning the
          contest, placing first out of 6,500 competitors. Future 2PM bandmates
          Taecyeon and Chansung had also competed. In 2008, he took part in
          Mnet's Hot Blood Men which follows the extreme training of 13 trainees
          in order to become a member of the boy band One Day. One Day spawned
          two boy bands, 2AM and 2PM. Six months after Hot Blood was aired on
          TV, 2PM debuted with their first single "10 Points out of 10 Points"
          from their first EP Hottest Time of the Day, but it wasn't until their
          second EP 2:00PM Time For Change which skyrocketed their success in
          the Korean music industry. As of 2017, the group has released six
          studio albums in Korea and four studio albums in Japan.
        </p>
        <p>
          Junho debuted as a solo singer in Japan with his first solo mini
          album, Kimi no Koe, for which he produced, composed and wrote all the
          tracks. The album landed on no. 1 in Tower Records′ charts and no. 3
          on Oricon′s daily chart. On July 9, Junho began his first solo tour,
          Junho 1st Solo Tour Kimi no Koe which ended on August 29 in Tokyo. In
          September, he released his first album in Korea, a special compilation
          album titled One. The album contained Korean version of 11
          self-composed Japanese songs that were released in the past. He
          concluded his solo concert "Last Night" at Seoul which was held at the
          Olympic Hall in Olympic Park, Seoul, from September 19–20.
