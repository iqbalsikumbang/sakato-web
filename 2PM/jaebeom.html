        <h2>~~~Profile of JAEBEOM ex-2PM a.k.a Jay Park~~~</h2>
        <p>
          Born in Edmonds, Washington, in the Seattle metropolitan area, Park
          showed great interest in hip hop music and breakdancing at a young
          age. Park attended Edmonds Woodway High School, where he spent most of
          his break and lunch times practicing dance with friends. In 2003, Park
          became one of the first members of the Seattle-based b-boy crew Art of
          Movement (AOM). In 2004, Park's mother, seeing how her son spent more
          time breakdancing than studying, suggested he audition for Korea-based
          JYP Entertainment. Park first appeared through Mnet's Hot Blood Men, a
          documentary-style reality program that showed the future members of
          One Day, split as idol groups 2AM and 2PM, in training. Park,
          finishing at the top spot with the most fan votes, became the leader
          of 2PM. On September 4, 2008, 2PM debuted with the song "10 Out of
          10". On September 4, 2009, unfavorable comments towards Korea were
          found on Park’s personal Myspace account from 2005.</p><p> The comments,
          written in English to a friend, were translated by Korean media,
          quickly spreading across hundreds of news articles. Park expressed
          deep remorse and shame over his forgotten words and issued an official
          apology, explained the unhappiness that he experienced during his
          early days as a trainee in an unfamiliar country where he lacked
          family, the ability to easily communicate, and an understanding of the
          culture. Although outraged protesters demanded that Park should be
          removed from 2PM, JYP Entertainment's CEO, Park Jin-young, stated on
          September 7, 2009, that he was going to continue as a part of the
          group. The following day, Park announced on his official fancafe that
          he would be leaving the group to calm the situation and return to his
          hometown, Seattle, Washington. He also apologized to the other 2PM
          members, and promised that he would "come back a better person". Park
          Jin-young then confirmed that 2PM would continue as a six-member
          group.

          Park began working with singer, producer, and fellow AOM member, Cha
          Cha Malone, releasing "Bestie" in both Korean and English, and a duet
          titled "Speechless". Also in 2010, Park began collaborations and
          forming close ties with rappers Dok2 and The Quiett of Illionaire
          Records, titling the partnership "AOM & 1llionaire". Park released his
          first Korean mini-album, Take a Deeper Look, in April, with the lead
          single "Abandoned". Take a Deeper Look debuted at number three in the
          Billboard World Album Charts and ranked number 26 on the Billboard
          Heatseekers Albums Chart. He released his first full-length Korean
          album, New Breed, in February, with the lead single "Know Your Name".
          The album reached number 1 twice on the Gaon Weekly album chart in
          South Korea. Jay Park held his first solo concert, New Breed Live in
          Seoul, on March 3 at the Olympic Hall of Seoul Olympic Park.</p><p>On April
          10 2013, Park released his single album "Joah", along with the music
          video for the title track. The feel-good song features an upbeat
          melody with the music video filmed in Park's hometown of Seattle. Jay
          Park participated as a judge on Mnet's Show Me the Money 4. In 2015 he
          released an extensive list of songs including "Lotto", "All I Got Time
          For", "On It", "Want It", "Mommae" and "Sex Trip". He released "My
          Last" featuring LOCO and Gray in July 17, 2015. Jay Park released his
          album WORLDWIDE in November 2015. In March 2016 Jay Park released a
          new song titled "The Truth Is". In 2017, Park also founded H1ghr Music
          with producer Cha Cha Malone. Currently, the label houses South Korean
          and American artist such as G.Soul, Groovyroom, Woogie, Sik-K, pH-1,
          Avatar Darko, Phe R.E.D.S, Raz Simone, and Jarv Dee. On July 20, 2018,
