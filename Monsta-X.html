            <h1>No.Mercy, KPOP Monster</h1>
            <p>
                The group was formed as the result of a survival program called No.Mercy, which was launched by Starship
                Entertainment and Mnet in December 2014. It consisted of 10 episodes and aired Wednesdays 11PM on
                Mnet. The premise of the show is that 12 trainees (13 after I.M joins the competition in episode 8)
                compete against each other through various performances and are ranked from 1-12. The group's name,
                "Monsta X", contains the double meaning of "Monsters conquering the K-pop scene" and "My star" (Mon
                means "My" in French). The X symbolizes an unknown existence. Joohoney, Hyungwon, and I.M also
                released their song "Interstellar" on February 12, which was produced for the final mission by producer
                Yella Diamond.
                Monsta X made their debut with the release of their first extended play, Trespass on May 14, 2015.
                The title song of the same name is produced by Rhymer and described as a "strong and edgy track that
                reflects Monsta X’s unique character".
            </p>
            <p>
                On September 1, the group returned with their second extended play titled Rush. The title track of the
                same name is described as a song representing the signature style of the group, produced by Giriboy.
                Keone Madrid choreographed the dance and Joo Hee-sun directed the music video. The mini-album
                contains six tracks produced by Mad Clown, Crybaby and Rhymer. Jooheon also took part in rap making for
                five out of the six tracks, while fellow member I.M was involved in four songs, including the title
                track "Rush". Monsta X also performed at the KCON 2015 in Los Angeles making it their first U.S.
                appearance and performance. Monsta X received the Next Generation Asian Artist award at 2015 Mnet
                Asian Music Awards and the 1theK Performance Award at 2015 Melon Music Awards.
