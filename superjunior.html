            <p>Super Junior also known as SJ or SuJu, is a

                Korean boy band formed on November 6, 2005, by producer Lee Soo-man of SM Entertainment. The group
                comprised
                a total of thirteen

                Kyuhyun
                joined the group later in 2006. Super Junior was the best-selling K-pop artist for four

                in a row. In
                2012,

            <h1>Super "Junior", Abandoned Rotational Concept, Gain Recognitions</h1>
            <p>In 2000, SM Entertainment held their first overseas casting auditions in
                Beijing 101, China and recruited Hankyung. That same
                year, Leeteuk, Yesung, and
                Eunhyuk were recruited. Sungmin and
                Donghae became trainees after jointly winning first place in an SM-sponsored contest in 2001. In 2002,
                Heechul and Kangin were recruited along with
                Kibum. Siwon became a trainee after
                being scouted in 2003. Shindong became a trainee in 2004. Ryeowook won the 2004 Chin Chin Youth Festival
                and became a trainee just
                two months before debut in 2005. Kyuhyun then joined the group in 2006, after winning third place in the
                2005 Chin Chin Youth Festival. After the members' showcased their different talents to the company at a
                picnic, the company finalized their group
                name to Super Junior, and officially became Super Junior'05, the first generation of Super Junior. The
                group officially debuted on SBS' music program Popular Song on November 6, 2005, performing their first
                single "Twins (Knock Out)". A digital single
                with "Twins (Knock Out)", "You Are the One", and three additional tracks were released online on
                November 8, followed by the release of their debut album Twins on December 6, 2005. In February 2006,
                Super Junior 05 began performances for "Miracle", the
                second promotional single from their debut album. </p>
            <p>As promotions for "Miracle" ended, SM Entertainment began selecting
                new members for Super Junior's second
                generation, Super Junior 06. The company even prepared a list of chosen members that were to graduate
                from the group. However, the company abandoned the rotational concept after adding a thirteenth member,
                Kyuhyun, in 2006. The group then became known
                as just Super Junior, without the suffix "05". After the addition of Kyuhyun, Super Junior released
                their single "U" for free
                download on May 25, 2006, on their official website.
                In late 2006, Kyuhyun, Ryeowook, and Yesung formed the subgroup Super Junior-K.R.Y., Super Junior's
                first sub-unit. They performed their first single "The One I Love", theme song to the Korean television
                drama Hyena. In February 2007, Leeteuk, Heechul,
                Kangin, Sungmin, Shindong and Eunhyuk formed Super Junior-T, a trot-singing group. They released their
                first single "Rokuko" on February 23, 2007. Super Junior's second official album was intended for a late
                2006 release, but due to several accidental
                setbacks, Don't Don was not released until September 20, 2007.</p>

            <h1>"Sorry, Sorry", Members Parted, "Bonamana"</h1>
            <p style="text-indent:30px;">Super Junior-M, Super Junior's Mandopop subgroup comprising members Hankyung,
                Siwon, Donghae, Kyuhyun, Ryeowook, and Super Junior-M members Henry and Zhou Mi, was formed in April
                2008.
                A fourth
                Super
                Junior subgroup was created soon
                after Super Junior-M's debut. With five members from Super Junior-T and Yesung, they formed the subgroup
                Super Junior-H, releasing their first extended play (EP) Cooking? Cooking! on June 5, 2008. The group
                released their third studio album Sorry, Sorry on
                March 12, 2009. It was their first album to debut at number one on the Hanteo Charts, selling over
                29,000
                copies the first day. The album's title single "Sorry, Sorry" became an instant hit.
                "Sorry, Sorry" achieved national and international success, and has since been the group's best-selling
                single in South Korea.</p>
            <p>The group was plagued by legal
                turmoils and lineup changes during their concert tour. Though Kibum was shown in the ads and promotional
                videos for Super Show 2,
                he did not officially participate in the concert tour, and announced his temporary leave from the group
                to
                pursue his acting career. In October 2009, Kangin was charged with a DUI and hit-and-run after crashing
                into
                a parked taxi holding three passengers.
                In December 2009, Hankyung filed for contract termination from SM Entertainment, claiming that the
                provisions of his contract were unlawful, harsh, and against his rights. He parted with the group and
                released his solo album Geng Xin in July 2010, which
                sold over 510,000 copies. That same month, Kangin announced his hiatus to fulfill his two-year mandatory
                military service. With only ten members left, Super Junior went off to release their fourth studio
                album,
                Bonamana in May 2010. To
                promote the album, Super Junior embarked
                on their third Asia-wide tour Super Show 3 in 2010 and 2011, and had sold-out concerts for each stop.
                Super
                Junior's performances were well received by the media, and they were honored as Korea's National Pop
                Culture
                Icon for their role in spreading the
                Hallyu Wave (Korean Wave), receiving the Minister of Culture Awards by the Ministry of Culture, Sports
                and

                tour,
                the Super Show 4 in November 2011. The group, with Super Junior-M members Zhou Mi and Henry, also

                2011 Winter SMTown – The Warmest Gift album, released on December 13, 2011. In addition, Donghae and
