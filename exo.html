          EXO is a South Korean–Chinese boy band based in Seoul, with nine
          members: Xiumin, Suho, Lay, Baekhyun, Chen, Chanyeol, D.O., Kai and
          Sehun. The band was formed by SM Entertainment in 2011 and debuted in
          2012. Originally with twelve members, three others were Luhan, Kris,
          and Tao. Their music incorporates genres like pop, hip-hop, and R&B,
          alongside electronic dance music genres like house, trap, and
          synth-pop. Since 2014, Exo has exclusively performed as one group,
          while continuing to release and perform music in multiple languages.
          Previously, the band debuted with twelve members separated into two
          sub-groups: Exo-K (Suho, Baekhyun, Chanyeol, D.O., Kai, and Sehun) and
          Exo-M (Xiumin, Lay, Chen, and former members Kris, Luhan, and Tao). SM
          Entertainment CEO, Lee Soo-man, revealed plans to debut a new boy band
          that would be divided into two sub-groups, promoting the same music
          simultaneously in South Korea and China by performing songs in both
          Korean and Mandarin. After several member changes in December 2011,
          the group finalized its name as Exo, taken from the word "exoplanet".
          The news of an upcoming debut from SM Entertainment attracted
          substantial media attention from within South Korea and
          internationally, with many comparing Exo to fellow SM boy band TVXQ.

        <h1>Beginning of EXO-K, EXO-L, and EXO-M</h1>
        <p>
          Exo-K's leader, Suho, was the first member to join SM Entertainment,
          in 2006. The following year, Kai won SM Youth Best Contest and
          received a contract. Chanyeol, who took second place in a Smart Model
          Contest, and Sehun, who went through four auditions in two years in
          2008. In 2010, Exo-K's D.O. sang for his audition and was eventually
          offered a contract. The last member of Exo-K to become a trainee was
          Baekhyun. In Exo-M, Kris auditioned in 2008 at a global SM
          Entertainment audition in Canada, before moving to South Korea for
          training. That same year, Lay auditioned in Changsha, China, and
          subsequently moved to South Korea, while Xiumin attended an audition
          with his friend and won second place. In 2010, Luhan was scouted by an
          SM Entertainment representative in Seoul and passed his audition,
          while Tao was scouted at a talent show. The last member to join Exo-M
          was Chen, who took part in the casting system in 2011.
        </p>
        <p>
          Exo-K and Exo-M debuted with the single "Mama" on April 8, 2012,
          followed by the EP Mama on April 9. The two sub-groups promoted the
          album separately; Exo-K performed on South Korean music program The
          Music Trend while Exo-M performed on the Top Chinese Music Awards in
          Shenzhen on the same day. Prior its debut, Exo released two singles,
          titled "What Is Love" and "History”. The group's first studio album,
          XOXO, was released on June 3, 2013, in two versions: one in Korean and
          one in Mandarin. Unlike the EP Mama, for which Exo-K and Exo-M had
          separate promotions, XOXO was jointly promoted, mainly in South Korea.
          Exo recorded the album's lead single "Wolf" together. A repackaged
          version of the album, titled Growl, was released on August 5, 2013,
          with three additional tracks. That December, Exo released a second EP,
          Miracles in December, as a special winter album containing the single
          of the same name. Exo's third EP, Overdose, was released on May 7,
          2014. Originally scheduled to be released on April 21, the album was
          delayed due to the Sewol Ferry accident on April 16.

        <h1>Lawsuit against SM, World Tour, Solo Activities</h1>
        <p>
          On May 15, 2014, Kris filed a lawsuit against Sm Entertainment to
          terminate his contract and alleged that SM: disregarded his health;
          maintained unfair profit distributions; restricted his freedom; and
          treated him like a product rather than a person. On May 24, the group
          began its first headlining tour, "Exo from Exoplanet 1 – The Lost
          Planet", at the Olympic Gymnastics Arena. Tickets for the concert sold
          out in 1.47 seconds. On October 10, Luhan also filed a lawsuit against
          SM Entertainment to terminate his contract. He cited health problems
          and alleged he was treated differently than the band's Korean members.
          On March 7, 2015, Exo began their second headlining world tour,
          "Exoplanet 2 – The Exo'luxion". The group released its second studio
          album Exodus on March 30, 2015. Lead single "Call Me Baby" was
          released ahead of schedule, on March 27, because versions of the song
          had been leaked online. Tao was absent during promotions for Exodus
          due to injuries and, on August 24, became the third member to file a
          lawsuit against SM Entertainment to terminate his contract. SM
          responded to his legal action with a statement: "Our company plans to
          use everything in our power including both Korean and Chinese legal
          professionals and partners to respond legally both in Korea and China
          in a multi-faceted manner. We also plan to take legal steps to respond
          to Tao's illegal promotions and actions."

          "Monster", were released on June 9, 2016. In June, Lay announced he
          would not take part in the band's next album, and would instead focus
          on his acting career. Since then, he has been absent from Exo albums
          and public appearances. Also in 2016, the group's members spent time
          advancing their solo careers. On January 7, Baekhyun released "Dream",
          a collaboration with popular South Korean singer Suzy. On October 31,
          Chen, Baekhyun, and Xiumin debuted as the group's first sub-unit,
          Exo-CBX, which is a combination of the first letter from each member's
          stage name. Exo-CBX released their debut EP Hey Mama! and the music
          video for the single of the same name on October 31. Lay's debuted as
          a solo artist in May 2016 with the release of "Monodrama" through the
          project SM Station. The song was a success in China.
