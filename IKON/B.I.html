                <h1>~~~Profile of B.I IKON~~~</h1>
                <p> Kim Hanbin, better known as B.I, was born on October 22, 1995. He is the leader,
                    lead
                    rapper and lead dancer of the South Korean boy group IKON. After over two years of training,
                    B.I partook on Mnet reality survival program WIN: Who Is Next as a contestant under Team B. The show
                    resulted with the victory of Team A, thus going back to training under the label. On May 14, 2014 it
                    was
                    revealed B.I as well as Bobby would compete in Mnet's Show Me the Money 3. Along the show, B.I
                    released
                    digital single "Be.I", soon becoming the first single from the show to top the charts. In September
                    2014,
                    it was announced Team B will be returning to compete on survival program Mix & Match, where filming
                    began in
                    midst of B.I's appearance on Show Me The Money. The show resulted with the debut of Team B alongside
                    trainee Jung Chan-woo under the name iKon. On June 14, 2019, it was revealed that the drug dealer
                    delivered
                    drugs to B.I and took drugs together, but was persuaded by the head of YG Entertainment, Yang
                    Hyun-suk,
                    to cover the fact from the police investigation. Following the allegation, Yang resigned from all
                    his
                    positions in the company. The dealer was revealed to be Han So-hee, a former female idol trainee,
                    who was involved in drug issues with T.O.P and has received four years of probation in 2017.</p>
