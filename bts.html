            <p>BTS, Bangtan Sonyeondan, also known as the Bangtan
                Boys, is a seven-member South Korean boy band formed in Seoul in 2013. The members are Jin, RM, Suga, J
                Hope, Jimin, V, and Jungkook.
                Originally a hip hop group, their musical style has evolved to include a wide range of genres. Their
                lyrics,
                often focused on personal and social commentary, touch on the themes of mental health, troubles of
                school-age youth, loss, the journey towards loving oneself, and individualism.
                The group initially formed as teenagers under Big Hit Entertainment and released their debut single
                album, 2
                Cool 4 Skool (2013). The band is the first and only Korean act as of 2019 to top the U.S. Billboard 200
                with
                their studio album Love Yourself: Tear (2018) and
                have since hit the top of the U.S. charts with their albums Love Yourself: Answer (2018) and Map of the
                Soul: Persona (2019) and Map of the Soul: 7 (2020), making BTS the first group since The Beatles to earn
                three number one albums in
                less
                than a year. The group's name, BTS, stands for the
                Korean expression Bangtan Sonyeondan, literally meaning "Bulletproof Boy Scouts". According to member
                J-Hope, the name signifies the group's desire "to block out stereotypes, criticisms, and expectations
                that
                aim on adolescents like bullets".</p>

            <h1>Originally Hip hop group to Contemporary Youth</h1>
            <p>BTS formed in 2010 after Big Hit Entertainment CEO Bang Si-hyuk met with group
                leader RM and was impressed with his rapping. On June 12, 2013, BTS released their debut single album 2
                Cool 4 Skool, the first
                installment in their "school trilogy" series,
                simultaneously with its lead single "No More Dream". Their subsequent single “We Are Bulletproof Pt. 2”.
                In 2 Cool 4
                Skool, BTS employed an old-school hip-hop
                sound with scratches from the 1980s-90s and excessively fierce visuals. From their inception, BTS was
                convinced that telling their story was the only way for the younger generation to relate to their music.
                Expanding their endeavors to Japan, "No More Dream" was
                later re-recorded in Japanese and released in June 2014. </p>
            <p>In September 2013, BTS released the second part to their "school trilogy,”
                Musically, BTS did not fundamentally change their sound as compared with 2 Cool 4 Skool, utilizing fiery
                rapping along with trap beats, brass, and soulful melodies. Lyrically, the EP expanded on the theme of
                dreams and happiness, revealing
                their frustration under the harsh Korean education system and their determination to confront the
                struggle of proving themselves. At the end of the year, BTS was recognized with several New Artist of
                the Year awards, including the 5th Melon Music Awards,
                28th Golden Disc Awards and the 23rd Seoul Music Awards. The last act to their "school trilogy", the EP
                Skool Luv Affair, was released in January 2014.
                Skool Luv Affair musically retained much of their hip-hop influences with the incorporation of R&B and
                hard rock, the album coincided with a thematic shift from dreams and happiness to love, focusing on
                school-age and youthful love.</p>

            <h1>Youth Series Made A Breakthrough</h1>
            <p> BTS held their first concert in the United States in West Hollywood for free
                to an
                audience of 200 fans. In August, the group also made their
                first appearance at KCON in Los Angeles. In August 2014, BTS released their first Korean studio album,
                Dark
                & Wild.
                It was supported by two singles: "Danger" and "War of Hormone". The album served as a narrative
                extension of the “school trilogy”
                and a transition into their next series. BTS shifted their sound and image from solely aggressive,
                masculine
                hip hop to more diverse styles, wanting to express the beauty and anxiousness of
                "youth", loosely interpreted to define "youth" as "the most beautiful moment in life." Their third EP,
                The
                Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Part 1 (March 2015), explored the growth and emotional agony of youth as
                well
                as its playful and uplifting sides. Its lead single "I Need U" was
                BTS' first top five hit in Korea and garnered BTS first ever music show win on SBS MTV's
                The Show. While its second single, "Dope", only peaked at number 44 in Korea, it peaked at number three
                on
                Billboard's World Digital Songs Chart.
            </p>
            <p>In November, BTS commenced their third concert tour, 2015 BTS LIVE "The Most
                Beautiful Moment in Life: On Stage", debuting their new song and the lead single from their fourth EP
                The
                Most Beautiful
                Moment in Life, Part 2, "Run", during the Seoul dates. Thematically, the EP focused more on the serious
                and
                speculative aspects of youth, touching on the pursuit of success, loneliness, affection for
                their origins, and the suffering of the younger generation due to unfavorable conditions in current
                society.
                Their first Korean compilation album and the finale to their "youth series", The Most Beautiful
                Moment in Life: Young Forever, was released in May 2016. It included three new singles: the top 40 hit
                "Epilogue: Young Forever", the top 10 hit "Fire", and the top 20 hit "Save Me".
                Wings
                Album got out with the lead single "Blood Sweat & Tears" achieved a music chart "all-kill" in South
                Korea

            <h1>International BTS Fever</h1>
            <p>In February 2017, BTS released the repackaged edition of Wings (2016), entitled
                You
                Never Walk Alone. September 2017, BTS released the first
                part
                of the series, their fifth EP, Love Yourself: Her and featured music from the Chainsmokers' Andrew
                Taggart for the track "Best of Me". The EP was supported by two singles: the lead single "DNA" and a
                Steve
                Aoki remix of their song "Mic Drop" featuring American rapper Desiigner. In the narrative sequence,
                the EP represented the "development" of the series and is considered by RM to be one of the major
                turning
                points in BTS' career. Within the larger narrative, Love Yourself: Her described the joy and
                happiness of falling in love.

            </p>
            <p>
                In May 2018, BTS released their third Korean-language studio album, Love
                Yourself:
                Tear
                with the premiere of their lead single, "Fake Love" In the narrative sequence, the album coincided with
                the
                "turn" of the series, touching on the tortuous enlightenment of loving without being loved and
                encouragement
                to those without dreams.
                As the conclusion of the Love Yourself series, BTS released their second Korean compilation album Love
                Yourself: Answer in August 2018, which contained songs from the previous Love Yourself releases along
                with
                seven additional new tracks.
                The album was supported by the lead single "Idol" and the alternative digital release featuring Nicki
                Minaj.
                Thematically, Love Yourself: Answer placed the songs of the Love Yourself series within the narrative
                of beginning, development, turn and conclusion to illustrate the excitement of love, the pains of
                farewell,
                and the enlightenment of self-love. </p>
