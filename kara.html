                    from
                    the
                    Greek word "chara", which they interpreted to mean "sweet melody".</p>

                <h1>Strong Female R&B, Sunghee Leave, Hot Issue</h1>
                <p>The group started off as a quartet with members consisting of Park Gyuri, Han
                    Seung-yeon, Kim Sung-hee, and Jung Nicole. The group debuted on March 29, 2007 with "Break It" on
                    M.net's M! Countdown from their first album The
                    First Blooming while displaying a strong female image and R&B sound. The album also produced the
                    singles
                    "If U Wanna" and "Secret World". They were often
                    compared to their senior labelmates, Fin.K.L,
                    because of their similarity and the fact that the two groups were signed to the same label.
                    Additionally, each individual member of Kara was paralleled to a member of Fin.K.L. All
                    promotions for their first album ended in the summer
                    of 2007. In August 2007, the group came out with a documentary on M.net called Kara Self Camera
                    which
                    showcased the group and their talents, as well as the relationship they had with each other. The
                    first
                    season debuted on August 8, 2007, and chronicled the
                    lives of the girls over 15 episodes, ending on December 12, 2007. As their first album was not a
                    commercial success, member Seungyeon participated in many television variety shows in the following
                    months to keep the group's name recognizable to the public.</p>
                <p>The group was scheduled to have their comeback in March 2008 with their second
                    album, however, member Kim Sung-hee suddenly announced that she would be leaving the group due to
                    parental pressure because her participation in the group
                    was contingent on the maintenance of her grades. In response, DSP stated that the second album that
                    was
                    recorded would be shelved and replaced by a mini-album to come in May; in addition, two members
                    would
                    join the group. Auditions were held, and the two new
                    members were eventually revealed to be Goo Ha-ra and Kang Jiyoung. The group made their return in
                    the
                    music industry as a quintet on July 24, 2008 with "Rock U" on M! Countdown. They made their comeback
                    with the "cute" and "playful" image which was the complete
                    opposite of the group's original image from their debut. The EP, Pretty Girl, was released on
                    December
                    4, embodying a "fun-party" concept. Park Gyuri attributed their popularity
                    increase to their "pretty but natural" appeal, while media reports gave credit to the band for
                    finally
                    finding its own identity in the music industry since
                    the group's debut and to older male fans, most notably singer Shin Hae Chul.</p>

                    number one single when it topped Gaon's weekly singles chart. Their single "Wanna" was released
                    on July 28, 2009 and immediately charted on various digital music charts. The music video was

                    31, beginning with KBS's Music Bank;
                    the group performed both "Wanna" and "Mister". "Mister" proved to be popular with netizens due to
                    the
                    "butt
                    dance" that is featured prominently in the choreography.</p>
                <p>After a short hiatus, DSP released two teaser photos of the group's
                    comeback
                    concept on February 9, 2010. The teaser video was released on February 12 on Naver; the EP, Lupin,
                    followed
                    on February 17. The music video was released on February 22,
                    On August 11, the group released their debut single, the
                    Japanese
                    remake of their Korean song, "Mister". The single ranked
                    in various music charts and proved to be very popular in Japan. The group later on released their
                    second
                    single entitled "Jumping" on November 10, 2010. On September 29, 2010, the group released their
                    compilation album, Kara Best
                    2007-2010.
                    The
                    album is a compilation of their selected Korean tracks. Their debut Japanese album, Girl's Talk, was
                    released on November 24, 2010.
                    After taking a nine-month hiatus in the Korean
                    music industry, the group announced the release of their single "Jumping", which was then promoted
                    in
                    both
                    Korea and Japan. It was released as the title track for their fourth Korean mini-album of the same

                    become future members of the group. On July 1,
                    Heo
                    Youngji was proclaimed the winner with a total
                    score of 49,591.</p>
                <p>The group released their mini-album, Day & Night, in South Korea in August
                    18. They returned with track titled "Mamma
                    Mia". A music
                    video was filmed in the Gyonggi Province on July 9. Mamma Mia was also released as their 11th
                    Japanese
                    single and the first single to feature Youngji after Nicole and Jiyoung departure. So Good was
                    announced
                    later as the B-side of the single. The group
                    released their seventh mini-album, In Love, on May 26, 2015. Its lead single, "Cupid", was performed
                    prior
                    to its official release at KBS' Dream Concert on May 23, 2015. The group released their fifth
                    Japanese
                    album, Girl's Story on June 17, 2015. The album
                    includes their cover of Fin.K.L's "Forever Love.". On January 15, 2016, DSP Media announced Gyuri,
                    Seungyeon
                    and Hara's departure from the group due to contracts expiring, resulting in the group's disbandment.
                    The
                    company also noted that Youngji would continue
                    her music career as a solo artist. Members Gyuri and Youngji have mentioned the possibility of
                    reunion
                    in
                    the future, though as of September 2016, no further updates have been released.</p>
