        <h1>Beyond The One Day</h1>
        <p>
          Following the Korean success of their 2010 album Saint o'Clock, the
          band released a Japanese version on November 9, 2011. In January 2012
          they toured Japan, becoming the first K-Pop idol group to perform at
          Tokyo Bunkamura Orchard Hall.
        </p>
        <p>
          The band followed up with the release of their second Japanese single
          You Wouldn't Answer My Calls" in Japan on April 11. In April 2012, 2PM
          and 2AM announced the release of the documentary film known as Beyond
          The One Day, in Japan. One Day refers to the group from which 2PM and
          2AM both split. On April 13, they released the trailer for the film.

        <h1>Promote in the Future</h1>
        <p>
          2AM released their first full-length Japan Album titled Voice on
          January 9, 2013. The album collected the tracks from their Japanese
          singles released to date. On March 5, 2013, 2AM released their
          full-length album, One Spring Day. The band released their EP,
          Nocturne, on November 19, 2013. The EP included 5 tracks. Due to
          member Jung Jinwoon's injury, 2AM did not promote the album on music
          programs. Members Seulong, Jo Kwon, and Jinwoon all officially
          switched their contracts back to JYP Entertainment after their
          contracts with Big Hit Entertainment expired in April, while Changmin
          stayed with Big Hit due to his involvement with Homme. A new album,
          Let's Talk would be the first under JYP Entertainment, after releasing
          their previous albums with Big Hit Entertainment.
        </p>
        <p>
          In March 2015 Seulong and Jinwoon decided not to renew their contracts
          with JYP Entertainment and would sign to other agencies. While
          Changmin ended his contract in August 2015, JYP Entertainment assured
          that the departures did not mean 2AM was breaking up. On September 22,
          2017, Jo Kwon parted ways with JYP Entertainment. He stated that,
          despite his departure from JYP Entertainment, 2AM had not disbanded
          and that the other members had clauses in their individual contracts
          which would allow them to promote as 2AM in the future. On November
          28, 2017, Seulong enlisted for his mandatory military service. In
          August 2018, Jo Kwon enlisted for his mandatory military service On
          January 17, 2019, it was announced Jinwoon would enlist in March. He
          will be the final member to enlist, due to Changmin's service
          completion in 2008.
