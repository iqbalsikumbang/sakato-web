            <h1>~~~Profile of LUNA F(X)~~~</h1>
            <p>Luna was born as Park Sun-young in Seoul, South Korea on August 12, 1993 to a family of classical vocal
                singers. She has an older brother, and an older twin sister named Park Jin-young. Luna is the only
                member of her family to not major in classical music. In 2006, SM Entertainment recruited Luna after
                seeing her performing on an SBS television program, Truth Game. She later debuted as the main
                vocalist and lead dancer of South Korean girl group f(x). In 2010, she appeared as the regular member of
                Star King for a long time and earned a Newcomer Award from the SBS Entertainment Awards for her
                appearance and effort. Later in the year, Luna recorded the song "Let's Go"
                alongside labelmates Sungmin, Seohyun, and Jonghyun, for the purpose of increasing public participation
                in the 2010 G-20 Seoul summit.
            </p>
            <p>In 2011, Luna was reported to making her musical debut and would take on the character Elle Woods in
                Legally Blonde. In April, she started hosting music program The Show from MTV Korea along with
                Secret's Hyoseong. In 2012, she appeared on Immortal Songs 2 as a contestant, performing Magma's "I
                Can't Know." Luna won the first place award for her performance. In 2014, Luna was also chosen to
                feature on "Dream Drive," the debut single of co-ed project team Play The Siren. In March 2015, she was
                announced to be acting in the web drama entitled Jumping Girl, alongside Block B members U-Kwon and
                B-Bomb. This would be her first time playing the female lead in an acting project.
