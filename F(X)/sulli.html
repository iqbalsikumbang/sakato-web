            <h1>~~~Profile of SULLI F(X)~~~</h1>
            <p>Choi Jin-ri (March 29, 1994 – October 13 or 14, 2019), better known by her stage name Sulli
                , was a South Korean actress, singer, and model. Sulli first made her debut as a child actress,
                appearing as a supporting cast member on the SBS historical drama Ballad of Seodong (2005). Following
                this, she earned a number of guest roles, appearing in the television series Love Needs a Miracle (2005)
                and Drama City (2007), and the film Vacation (2006). After signing a record deal with SM Entertainment, Sulli rose to prominence as a member of the
                girl group f(x) formed in 2009. Concurrently with her music career, Sulli returned to acting by starring in the SBS romantic
                comedy series, To the Beautiful You (2012).
            </p>
            <p>Sulli's film career progressed with her starring in the fantasy swashbuckler The Pirates (2014) and the
                coming-of-age drama Fashion King (2014). During the press tour for The Pirates, Sulli took a hiatus from
                the entertainment industry due to health issues and following a year long absence from promoting with
                f(x), she left the group in August 2015. Between 2015 and 2017, she embarked on a number of modelling
                campaigns before becoming a global brand ambassador for Estée Lauder.[citation needed] Sulli garnered
                attention for her role in the experimental neo-noir thriller Real (2017). She later returned to the
                music industry in 2018, making a guest appearance on Dean's single "Dayfly" and releasing her debut solo
                single "Goblin" in June 2019, which was her last musical project prior to her death.

            <p>Sulli, in real life, spoke out against cyberbullying, which affected her personally as she was often the
                target of online abuse for her dichotomous public image. She expressed her hope that people
                could accept each other's differences and said, "there are so many unique types of people in this
                country with so much talent and I feel like they're wasting it by putting their energy into critiquing
                others like this online." Following her death, "Love You Sulli" (설리 사랑해) started trending in an attempt
                by fans to hide negative search results. IU's song "Peach", which was written about
                Sulli, re-entered music charts. Goo Hara, who was Sulli's close friend, died by suicide a
                month after Sulli's death.</p>
