      <h1>~~~Profile of CHOA AOA~~~</h1>
      <p>Choa was born on March 6, 1990, in Incheon, South Korea.
        Her first step in becoming an idol was when she met Juniel and was told by her about FNC's auditions for their
        girl group, AOA. On July 30, 2012, Choa made her debut as a member of AOA on Mnet's M Countdown with the song
        "Elvis" from their debut single album, Angels' Story. On March 25, 2015, it was revealed that Choa will be one
        of the permanent MCs for MBC's We Got Married.
        On June 6, 2015, she became a new model for 'Alba Heaven' with Yoo Byung-jae.
        On 22 July 2015, it was revealed that Choa will collaborate with Primary and Iron for Primary's new single 2-3
        's song "Don't Be Shy". The song and the full music video starring Choa was released on July 24, 2015.
      </p>
      <p>On June 22, 2017, Choa announced that she would be leaving AOA due to depression and insomnia. She stated that
        she had tried using medication to help, however, there was no improvement in her mental health. This followed
        after Choa had a hiatus from the group following their activities from January 2017 when they released their
        first studio album Angel's Knock. Her departure from AOA was officially confirmed by FNC Entertainment on June
        30, 2017.

        – Choa’s ideal type: “It differs every time. He’s okay if his overall image is okay. I like styles that are neat
        and smart, like Choi Yoon (Kim Min Jong) in [SBS’] A Gentleman’s Dignity. I look at fashion more than looks. I
        used to love Ryu Jin sunbaenim a lot.”
