      <h1>~~~Profile of SEOLHYUN AOA~~~</h1>
      <p>Seolhyun was born on January 3, 1995 in Bucheon, South Korea. In 2010, Seolhyun won the 8th Smart Model Contest
        , a competition in which ordinary students wear uniforms. At the event, several talent agencies
        were present, and Seolhyun was scouted by her current management, FNC Entertainment. On July 30, 2012, Seolhyun
        made her debut as a member of AOA on Mnet's M Countdown with the song "Elvis" from their debut single album,
        Angels' Story. Soon afterwards, she made her acting debut in the television drama My Daughter Seo-young, playing
        the role of Lee Jung-shin's girlfriend.
        In 2013, she was cast in the daily drama Ugly Alert. She played the youngest daughter of the family, a bright
        girl who dreams of becoming an actress.
      </p>
      <p>Seolhyun first attracted attention with her appearance on the KBS variety show, Brave Family (2015), where she
        charmed viewers with boyish and unaffected demeanor. Later that year, she gained fame through a
        commercial for SK Telecom which led to increased advertising offers for the star. The same year, Seolhyun
        starred in KBS's vampire romance Orange Marmalade. Although it racked a mere two percent viewer ratings, the
        show brought her praise for her acting. In March 2016, Seolhyun was selected as an official ambassador to Korea
        national elections in 2016.
        In May 2017, Seolhyun was cast in historical film The Great Battle, directed by Kim Kwang-sik. Principal
        photography starts in August and the film premiered in 2018. She then starred in the thriller Memoir of a
        Murderer, playing the role of a murderer's daughter.
        In 2019, Seolhyun was cast as female lead in JTBC's historical drama My Country. This marks her first
        small-screen role in four years.
