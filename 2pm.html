            <h1>Hot Blood, Jimseung-dol</h1>
            <p>2PM is a South Korean boy band formed
                by JYP Entertainment. The current members are Jun. K, Nichkhun, Taecyeon,
                Wooyoung, Junho and Chansung. Former leader
                Jaebeom officially left the band in early 2010. The members of 2PM all auditioned (except Nichkhun, who
                was
                scouted) to become
                part of JYP Entertainment. Some members already had experience in the entertainment industry, including
                Jun. K, who had won several singing
                competitions. Ok Taecyeon, Lee Junho and Hwang Chansung had participated in the show SuperStar Survival.
                Some of the members had previously lived in the U.S., former leader Jaebeom in the Seattle area,
                Nichkhun in Southern California, while Taecyeon
                spent seven years in Massachusetts before returning to Korea. A documentary called Hot Blood Men
                captured the group's training
                days. In this documentary, former member
                Jaebeom finished at the top spot and received the most fan votes. The
                band was then split into four-member ballad group 2AM and seven-member hip-hop group 2PM.</p>
            <p> While most
                Korean boy bands at the time adopted a "pretty boy" image, 2PM constructed a tough and macho beast-like
                image when they made their debut. By emphasizing their masculine images, 2PM created the "jimseung-dol"
                (jimseung means an animal or beast in Korean) phenomenon in 2008. Jaebeom was chosen to serve as the
                group's leader. He played key roles in
                several of the band's early singles and associated music videos. 2PM debuted with their single "10 Out
                of 10" on 4 September 2008.
                In April 2009, the group released their second mini album, 2:00PM Time For Change, which they began
                promoting that month. On 11 June, 2PM began promotions
                for "I Hate You" on M!Countdown. In July 2PM achieved first place on the M!Countdown and
                Music Bank charts for the song "I Hate You".</p>

            <h1>Jay Park Left, Hands UP</h1>
            <p> On 30 July, 2PM won the 'Only One Song' award on M!Countdown. Later that year
                a controversy regarding Jaebeom
                emerged. Some demanded that Jaebeom should be forced
                out of 2PM, JYP Entertainment CEO Park Jin-young stated
                on 7 September lent the singer a vote of confidence, suggesting that he would remain in the group. Yet
                the following day, Jaebeom announced on his official fancafe that he would leave the group.
                Park Jin-young confirmed
                that 2PM would continue on as a six-member group. Despite the controversy, the group
                went ahead with release of its first studio album.
                Known as 01:59PM, the album was released on 10 November 2009. The group began promotional activities for
                the album on a variety of music shows. A week and a half after
                the album's release, 2PM performed at and was honored at the M.net Asian Music Awards with awards for
                Best Male Group and Artist of the Year. The group paid homage to Jaebeom during their performance
                of "Again & Again".</p>
            <p>The group made their
                television performance comeback on Mnet's music program M! Countdown. In July 2010, Taecyeon and
                Wooyoung
                left their position of MCs at SBS Inkigayo. The next month, Wooyoung also left Winwin to concentrate on
                2PM's busy schedule. The 1st concerts took place
                on 31 July 1 August (in Seoul) & 7, 8 August (in Busan) (2AM & Miss A were invited as the guests of the
                concert). In October
                2010, 2PM released their fourth EP, Still 2:00PM, with the lead single "I'll Be Back" staying at number
                one
                for two consecutive weeks in the Music
                Bank. 2PM officially made their Japanese debut in December 2010 with their first live event in Japan,
                the
                platinum showcase was called "2PM 1st
                Contact in JAPAN" LIVE. In May 2011, 2PM
                released their Japanese debut-single, "Take Off."</p>
                <p> The album "Hands Up" was released later that month on 20 June 2011.
                For the first time, the album featured two songs
                composed by 2PM members: "HOT" by Minjun and "Give it to Me" by Junho. On 30 November 2011, 2PM released
                their first studio album in Japanese language, Republic of 2PM. The main point of the album artwork
                motif is a taste of the 1950s and 1960s.
                In April 2012, 2PM announced plans to release a documentary film with 2AM, to be known as Beyond The One
                Day, in Japan. One Day refers to the group from which 2PM and 2AM both split. On 13 April, they released
                the
                trailer for the film.</p>

                their comeback album GO CRAZY! and revealed that their comeback would be released on 10 September. They
                then

                six members of 2PM signed their renewal to JYP Entertainment with Taecyeon's renewal to be discussed
                after
