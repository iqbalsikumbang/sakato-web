          member of the K-pop group 2NE1, which went on to become one of the
          best-selling girl groups of all time before their disbandment in 2016.

          single, "Kiss," featuring fellow 2NE1 member CL, in 2009. The group's
          hiatus beginning in 2014 allowed Park to focus on her television
          career, co-hosting the South Korean variety show Two Yoo Project Sugar
          Man, and appearing as a judge on the Philippine talent show Pinoy
          Boyband Superstar. She also acted in several web series, including

          festival. Following 2NE1's break-up at the end of 2016, Park renewed
          her contract with YG Entertainment.
