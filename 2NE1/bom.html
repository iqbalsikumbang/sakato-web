        <h2>~~~Profile of Bom 2NE1~~~</h2>
        <p>
          Park Bom was born in Seoul, South Korea, on March 24, 1984. Her older
          sister, Park Go-eun, is a cellist. Park lived in the United States
          from the ages of eleven to twenty-one. Whilst attending junior high
          school, Park was diagnosed with attention-deficit disorder (ADD). Park
          returned to South Korea to pursue a music career there and repeatedly
          auditioned to join YG Entertainment, where she was accepted into the
          company after three years of auditioning. During her time as a trainee
          at YG, Park was diagnosed with lymphadenitis; Park has continued to
          suffer from epidsodes of lymphadenitis ever since. In 2006, she
          featured on two of Big Bang's earliest singles, "We Belong Together"
          and "Forever with U" Park was placed as the main vocalist of 2NE1,
          alongside CL, Dara, and Minzy.In 2013, Park formed a
          sub-unit group with labelmate Lee Hi, known as Bom & Hi. The duo
          released a cover of Mariah Carey's "All I Want for Christmas Is You"
          on December 17. The same year, she also featured on the Japanese
          version of G-Dragon's single "Black".</p><p>In 2014, it was released to the
          public that Park had been under investigation for drug smuggling (80
          amphetamine containing tablets) through international mail in the
          past. A package, sent by family members residing in the United States
          to her residing in South Korea, was stopped at Incheon International
          Airport customs. Park was put under investigation but was never
          charged. In a statement issued by YG Entertainment's Yang Hyun-suk, he
          spoke against the allegations of preferential treatment. He explained
          that the drug was illegal in South Korea but legal in the United
          States. She was unable to travel to the United States during that time
          due to her busy schedule. Park contacted her U.S. physician to refill
          her medication. Yang further explained that Park sought out medical
          care from South Korean physicians and had undergone therapy but proved
          to be not as effective as her treatment in the United States.On July
          20, 2018, Park reportedly signed an exclusive contract with the newly
          established entertainment company D-Nation Entertainment. It was
          planned that she would be releasing her debut mini-album consisting of
          five to six tracks in November, as well as promotional activities
          overseas.
