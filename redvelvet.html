            <h1>Predebut, Debut, New Member, and The Red</h1>
            <p>Seulgi was the first member to be cast as an SM Entertainment trainee through
                an audition in 2007, while Irene was cast in 2009, and Yeri in 2011. In 2012,
                Wendy and Joy were cast through the SM Global Auditions in Canada and Seoul respectively. Preparations
                for Red Velvet began in late 2013, through SM Entertainment's trainee group SM Rookies.
                Irene and Seulgi were introduced initially to the public through the said project team in 2013, followed
                by Wendy in 2014. The three members were rumored to debut as a group in July, which was
                then confirmed by SM Entertainment. With the addition of member Joy, the four-member group would debut
                as Red Velvet, SM Entertainment's first girl group in five years since f(x). On August 1, 2014,
                Red Velvet made their official debut stage on the music program Music Bank. Their debut single,
                "Happiness", was digitally released on August 4. The original music video for "Happiness" gained more
                than 2 million views on YouTube in its first 24 hours of release before being removed due to controversy
                over problematic background images and replaced with an edited version. "Happiness" was
                the second-most viewed K-pop music video worldwide for the month of August in 2014. Red Velvet released
                their second digital single "Be Natural" and its music video on October 13, 2014. The song,
                which includes a rap verse by NCT member Taeyong, is a remake of the 2000 song of the same name by
                S.E.S., SM Entertainment's first girl group.</p>
            <p>On March 11, 2015, SM Rookies member Yeri was officially announced as part of
                the group. On March 15, the group's first mini-album Ice Cream Cake was released.
                The group promoted with double lead singles "Automatic" and "Ice Cream Cake" for which the music videos
                were released on March 14 and 15. In August 2015, Red Velvet held their first U.S. performance
                during the annual KCON convention and music festival in Los Angeles, California. Red Velvet's first
                full-length album, The Red, was released on September 9, 2015, with a total of ten tracks
                including the lead single "Dumb Dumb". The Red debuted at number 1 on Billboard's World Albums Chart and
                South Korea's Gaon Album Chart, and also appeared in Billboard's list of the "10 Best K-Pop Albums
                of 2015"</p>

            <h1>The Velvet to Perfect Velvet</h1>
            <p> Red Velvet's second mini album The Velvet and its title track "One of These
                Nights" was only released on March 17.
                The album showcases the smooth R&B-influenced "velvet" side of the group's concept and is a direct
                follow-up
                album to The Red, which highlighted the group's bright and bold "red" persona.
                The group released their third extended play Russian Roulette on September 7. The album consisted of
                seven
                tracks, with the lead single titled "Russian Roulette". On September 13,
                2016, Red Velvet took their first music show win for Russian Roulette on The Show. On February 1, 2017,
                Red
                Velvet released their fourth mini album, Rookie. The EP consisted of six tracks;
                it featured the title track "Rookie" and a solo track by Wendy titled "Last Love".
                The group took their first music show win for "Rookie" on The Show on February 7, followed by wins on
                Show
                Champion, M Countdown, Music Bank, and Inkigayo. Red Velvet starred in their first
                reality television program, Level Up Project which showcased the footage of the their trip to Thailand.
                The
                show aired for 23 episodes, and was shot without member Joy who was filming the
                drama The Liar and His Lover where she was the female lead.</p>
            <p>On July 9, Red Velvet released their first summer special extended play The Red
                Summer with the title track "Red Flavor". It was
                their first summer release. The EP was a commercial success, again topping the Gaon Album Chart and the
                Billboard World Albums Chart. On August 18, the group held their first solo concert titled
                "Red Room" to an audience of 11,000. Although it was initially planned to be a two-day concert, another
                day
                was added due to demand. Red Velvet revisited their "velvet" image by releasing
                their second full-length album Perfect Velvet on November 17 with the lead single "Peek-a-Boo". Unlike
                their
                first "velvet" release, the album and single were both commercially successful.
                The album peaked atop Billboard's World Album Chart. "Peek-a-Boo" peaked at number 2 on Billboard's
                World
                Digital Songs chart, tying with their 2016 single "Russian Roulette".</p>
