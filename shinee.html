            <h1>R&B Boy Group, Shines Bright, Outstanding Choreo</h1>
            <p>SM Entertainment, introduced an upcoming contemporary R&B boy group with its
                goal to be trendsetters in all areas of music, fashion and dance. The group's Korean name, Shinee, is a
                new coined word and is explained as a combination of shine, meaning light, and the suffix ee, therefore
                meaning "one who receives the light". On May 22, 2008, the group's first EP, Replay, was released, which
                debuted at number
                ten on the Korean music charts and peaked at number eight. On May 25, 2008, Shinee had their first stage
                performance on SBS's Inkigayo with their single
                "Replay". In June 2008, the
                group won their first award, "Rookie of the Month". In the same month,
                Shinee subsequently
                released their first full-length album, The SHINee World, which debuted at number three. October 30,
                2008, a repackaged version of The Shinee World, titled A.Mi.Go, was released, which
                includes three new songs:
                "Forever or Never", a remix of "Love Should Go On", and the title track "Amigo". "A.Mi.Go" is a
                shortened version of the Korean phrase "Areumdaun Minyeoreul Joahamyeon Gosaenghanda", which can be
                translated to "The heart aches when
                you fall in love with a beauty".</p>
            <p>Shinee's second extended play, Romeo, was released on May 25. Its lead single,
                "Juliette", was released earlier on May 18. The song is an instrumental remake of Corbin Bleu's
                "Deal with It". Shinee had their first stage performance for the song on KBS's Music Bank in June 2009,
                where the group also received the award for the first place. Shinee released the digital version of
                their third extended play, 2009,
                Year of Us, on October 19, 2009, with a physical release on October 22. The lead single, "Ring Ding
                Dong", was released digitally on October 14 and charted atop of several Korean music charts and gained
                popularity all over Asia.
                On July 19, 2010, the group released their second full-length studio album, Lucifer, which topped
                various physical and digital sales charts in South Korea. The songs on the album "were more carefully
                selected than ever", and the
                album is said to "[give] listeners a great chance to experience the diverse musical characters and more
                mature vocal skills of the members." The group made their comeback on July 23, 2010, at KBS Music Bank.
                For its outstanding
                choreography, "Lucifer" was nominated for the Best Dance Performance Award at the Mnet Asian Music
                Awards. The album
                was re-released under the title Hello. On December 26, 2010,
                Shinee commenced their
                first concert tour, Shinee World, at Yoyogi National Gymnasium in Tokyo.</p>
