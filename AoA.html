                AOA is a South Korean girl group formed by FNC
                Entertainment. The group is composed of five members: Jimin, Yuna, Hyejeong, Seolhyun and Chanmi.
                Originally an eight-piece group, Youkyung departed from the group in October 2016, followed by Choa in
                June 2017 and Mina in May 2019. AOA began their career simultaneously promoting as a dance group and
                band, and officially debuted in July 2012 with the release
                of the single album Angel's Story. Explaining the concept of their debut, FNC revealed that seven
                members are "full angels": Seolhyunari (Seolhyun), Choaya (Choa), Hyejeong.Linus (Hyejeong),
                Chanmi T.T (Chanmi), Yunaria (Yuna), Minaring (Mina), and leader Jiminel (Jimin), while
                Youkyoung (or "Y") is listed as a "half-angel/half-mortal" as she is only a member when the group
                promotes as a band, thus they were known as a "7+1" group. The song and music video for their debut
                title track "Elvis" was released on July 30.
