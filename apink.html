                With

                and Jeon Goon. The single, which continued the new direction taken by the group with "I'm So Sick",
                topped
                several music charts in South Korea after its release and peaked at No. 17 on the Gaon digital
                chart,
                while the album reached No. 3 on the Korean chart and No. 14 on the Billboard World Albums chart.</p>
