        <h2>~~~Profile of G-DRAGON BIGBANG~~~</h2>
        <p>
          Kwon Ji-yong (Korean: 권지용; born August 18, 1988), also known by his
          stage name G-Dragon, is a South Korean singer-songwriter, rapper,
          record producer, entrepreneur and fashion icon, often dubbed as the
          king of K-Pop. From age twelve, G-Dragon trained for six years at
          South Korean entertainment label YG Entertainment before debuting in
          2006 as the leader of the hip hop boy band Big Bang, which went on to
          become one of the best-selling boy bands in the world. His first solo
          album Heartbreaker and its title track of the same name, released in
          2009, were commercially successful, becoming the best-selling album by
          a Korean soloist at the time and earning him Album of the Year at the
          2009 Mnet Asian Music Awards.</p><p>G-Dragon collaborated with Big Bang
          bandmate T.O.P to release the album GD & TOP in 2010. His first EP One
          of a Kind (2012), was critically acclaimed and yielded three singles:
          "One of a Kind", "Crayon", and the chart-topper "That XX". The EP
          earned Record of the Year at the 2013 Seoul Music Awards. In 2013, he
          embarked on his first worldwide tour as a solo artist, making him the
          first Korean soloist to tour Japanese dome arenas. G-Dragon was
          awarded Artist of the Year at the 2013 Mnet Asian Music Awards
          following the success of his second album Coup d'Etat (2013). His 2017
          EP, Kwon Ji Yong, yielded the number one single "Untitled, 2014", and
          the supporting concert tour Act III: M.O.T.T.E became the largest tour
          ever conducted by a Korean soloist. Widely recognized for his
          influence on youth culture, fashion trends, and music in South Korea,
          G-Dragon was named by Forbes in 2016 as the most influential person
          under 30 in Asia's entertainment and sports. Producing not only for
          his band but also for his and his bandmates' solo releases, G-Dragon
          has written or co-written 23 number one songs on the Gaon Digital
          Chart (equivalent to the Billboard Hot 100), most of which he has also
          co-produced.
