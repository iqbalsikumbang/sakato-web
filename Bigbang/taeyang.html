        <h2>~~~Profile of TAEYANG BIGBANG~~~</h2>
        <p>
          Dong Young-bae (Korean: 동영배; born 18 May 1988), better known by his
          stage names Taeyang (meaning "sun" in Korean) and SOL (when performing
          in Japan), is a South Korean singer, songwriter and dancer. After
          appearing in Jinusean's music video "A-yo," Taeyang began training
          under YG Entertainment at the age of 12. Six years later, he made his
          debut in 2006 as a member of the South Korean boy band Big Bang. While
          the quintet's debut was met with lukewarm receptions, their follow-ups
          cemented their popularity, becoming one of the best-selling digital
          group of all-time in Asia and one of the best-selling boy bands in the
          world. Following the release of several albums and extended plays with
          his group, Taeyang pursued a solo career in 2008, releasing his first
          extended play, Hot.</p><p>The EP was acclaimed by critics, and went to win
          the award for Best R&B & Soul Album at the 6th Korean Music Awards.
          Hot was followed by his first full-length studio album, Solar (2010). His second studio album,
          Rise (2014) becoming
          the highest ranking album by a Korean soloist in the chart, while its
          lead single, "Eyes, Nose, Lips", peaked at number one on the Billboard
          K-pop Hot 100.
          "Eyes, Nose, Lips" was awarded Song of the Year at the 2014 Mnet Asian
          Music Awards and 29th Golden Disc Awards. His third studio album,
          White Night, was released in 2017. Labeled as the Korean "Prince of
          R&B," Taeyang's vocal skills have been admired by music critics and he
          is regarded as one of the best vocalists in South Korea.

          times…’Who is your ideal type in the entertainment business?’ I really
          don’t have one. That’s the truth. When reporters ask me about my ideal
          type, I can’t answer them accurately. Even though there have been
          girls that I’ve really liked, I haven’t thought about any of them
          being my ideal type just by judging from appearances because it’s
          different every time. There’s no reason to complicate things any
          further.”
