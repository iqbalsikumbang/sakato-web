        <h2>~~~Profile of SEUNGRI BIGBANG~~~</h2>
        <p>
          Lee Seung-hyun (Korean: 이승현; born December 12, 1990), better known
          by his stage names Seungri (Hangul: 승리; Victory) and V.I (when
          performing in Japan), is a former South Korean singer, songwriter,
          record producer, actor, entrepreneur, DJ and creative director. In the
          mid-2000s, Seungri rose to prominence as one of three vocalists and
          youngest member of the South Korean boy band Big Bang under YG
          Entertainment, which eventually became one of the best-selling digital
          groups of all-time in Asia and one of the best-selling boy bands in
          the world. With the release of the group's second studio album
          Remember (2008), in which the second single released, "Strong Baby",
          was performed solely by Seungri, he began to adopt a more mature image
          as an artist. Seungri furthered this image with the release of his
          first extended play, V.V.I.P in 2011.</p><p>The EP debuted at number one on
          the Gaon Album Chart and yielded two singles: "VVIP" and "What Can I
          Do". The latter peaked at number seven on the Gaon Digital Chart and
          the album sold over 50,000 copies. His second Korean EP Let's Talk
          About Love (2013) fared better, becoming his second number one album
          and selling over 80,000 copies. Let's Talk About Love was supported by
          "Gotta Talk to You", which charted at number three on the Gaon Chart
          and was later re-released in Japan as his first full Japanese studio
          album, containing previous materials from the two EPs recorded in the
          country's native language. In 2018, he released his first Korean
          studio album, the chart-topper The Great Seungri and embarked on his
          first world tour as a solo artist. Making his theatrical debut with
          the musical Sonagi in 2008, Seungri went on to star in films such as
          Nineteen and Why Did You Come to My House?, both released in 2009.

          <p> He
          branched into television with the Japanese drama Kindaichi Shonen no
          Jikenbo (2013) and the South Korean television series Angel Eyes
          (2014). In recent years, he's explored other ventures, including
          opening a dance academy, owning a nightclub and restaurant franchise,
          founding a record label and investing in other businesses. On March
          11, 2019, Seungri retired from the entertainment industry amidst
          allegations of him supplying prostitutes in 2015; a police
          investigation is ongoing into the Burning Sun scandal.</p>

          – He is known for his blunt attitude and his over confidence.<br />
