      <p>Kim Ki-bum (born September 23, 1991), better known by his stage
        name Key, is a South Korean singer, actor, fashion designer and television presenter. Born and raised in Daegu,
        South Korea, he later
        travelled to Seoul after a successful audition at the S.M. National Tour Audition Casting. In May 2008, Key
        debuted as a member of South Korean boy group Shinee, who later went on to become one of the best-selling
        artists in South Korea. Key is widely
        recognised as a singer, but he has also ventured into different careers, notably as an actor and fashion
        designer. As a singer, he has collaborated with various artists, and debuted in the sub-unit Toheart with
        Woohyun of Infinite.</p><p>He made his debut as a soloist
        in November 2018 with the release of the digital single "Forever Yours", and his first studio album, Face, was
        released later that month. Key has also contributed to songwriting that have been released in Shinee's and
        Toheart's albums. As an actor, he was
        cast in multiple musicals, such as Bonnie & Clyde (2013), Zorro (2014), and Chess (2015). He has since widened
        his field as an actor by taking part in several television drama roles, like Drinking Solo (2016) and The
        Guardians (2017).</p>
