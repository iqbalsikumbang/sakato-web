        musically active as main vocalist of Shinee and as a solo artist until his death on December 18, 2017, when he
        committed suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning. His final album, Poet | Artist, was released posthumously on
        January 23, 2018. It was announced,
        prior to the release, that all profits from the album would be given to Jonghyun's mother and be used to start a
