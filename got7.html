            <h1>Trained in JYP, Got It?</h1>
            <p>In 2009, JB and Jinyoung were cast into JYP Entertainment after passing open
                auditions. In 2010, Mark and BamBam were respectively scouted by JYP scouts in Los Angeles, USA and
                Bangkok, Thailand. That same year,
                Yugyeom became a JYP trainee after he was offered an opportunity at his dance school. In December,
                Jackson passed JYP's overseas audition in Hong Kong, but he did not start his training until the summer
                of 2011. The seventh and final member to join the group
                was Youngjae, who had only been a trainee for seven months. JYP Entertainment announced Got7 on January
                1, 2014, debuting their first boy group since 2PM in 2008. According to Park Jin-young, the name
                originated from best-selling first-generation group g.o.d,
                as Park was supposed to debut with them as a six-member mix-gender group and used the working name
                "GOT6". Got7 was described as a hip-hop group that incorporates martial arts tricking and b-boying
                styles in their performances. This style
                drew comparisons to their senior group, 2PM, who are well known for their acrobatic dance styles. The
                group released their first EP, Got It?, on January 20, 2014. Got7 made their official music program
                debut on January 16, 2014, through Mnet's M Countdown,
                performing their debut single "Girls Girls Girls". On June 23, Got7 released their second EP, Got Love,
                with its title song "A", which was written and produced by J.Y. Park. For their new EP, the group opted
                to show a brighter and more colorful image
                than their martial arts and b-boy style choreography emphasized at debut. In November 2014, the group
                released their first full-length album, Identify, as well as the music video for its title track, "Stop
                Stop It". In October, Got7 held their first Japan Tour,
                "Got7 1st Japan Tour 2014", and made their Japanese debut on October 22 with their single Around the
                World. This included the hip-hop track "So Lucky", composed and written by 2PM's Jun. K.</p>
            <p>On June 10, 2015, the group released their second Japanese single "Love Train",
                which debuted at #4 on the Oricon Singles Chart. The group released their third EP, Just Right, on July
                13, 2015. The title track, "Just Right", peaked at #3 on Billboard's
                World Digital Songs chart, remaining in the top three for two consecutive weeks. The group released
                their fourth EP, Mad, and the music video for its title track, "If You Do", on September 29. They
                followed up this release with their first repackaged
                album, Mad: Winter Edition, on November 23, with the three additional tracks, "Confession Song",
                "Everyday" and "Farewell".</p>
