      <h1>~~~Profile of KYUHYUN SUPER JUNIOR~~~</h1>
      <p>Kyuhyun was born in Nowon-gu, Seoul, a northeastern part of the
        city. He went on to place third in the Chin
        Chin Singing Competition in 2005 and entered SM Entertainment the following year. Kyuhyun officially made his
        debuted in 2006 as a new member of Super Junior. Shortly after his debut, Kyuhyun along with members Yesung and
        Ryeowook were formed the Super Junior's first
        subgroup, Super Junior-K.R.Y..The trio debuted on November 5 on KBS's weekly music program Music Bank. In 2008,
        Kyuhyun joined Super Junior Chinese sub-group Super Junior-M. In November 2010, Kyuhyun along with label mates TRAX’s Jay, SHINee’s
        Jonghyun, and newly debuted singer Jino formed the project group SM The Ballad. The group was described as SM
        Entertainment's vocal unit group, but the original members
        would only promote that winter together.</p><p>In August 2013, Kyuhyun graduated from Kyunghee University's postmodern
        music department with a bachelor's degree. He enrolled for his master's the following month. News sources
        reported the graduations of Kyuhyun and classmate Kim Yeon-ji
        as unusual examples of entertainment stars taking their academic work seriously, to which Kyuhyun remarked, "I
        worked hard to get into university, so I was very attached."
      On November 13, 2014, Kyuhyun released his debut album, titled At
        Gwanghwamun, making him the first Super Junior
        member to debut alone. Kyuhyun made his first music show appearance on KBS2's Music Bank on November 14.
        Just 12 hours after the album's online release, the title track, "At Gwanghwamun", achieved an 'all-kill' by
        topping all nine digital Korean charts.
