      <h2>~~~Profile of HENRY SUPER JUNIOR~~~</h2>
      <p>Henry Lau born October 11, 1989 in Toronto, Canada. Henry appeared
        as a violinist in South Korean group Super Junior's music video for "Don't Don" in September 2007. The song
        includes a violin part, which is played
        by Lau. SM Entertainment officially announced Lau to be a member of a new Super Junior sub-unit, causing
        controversy among fans. Previously, there were rumors stating that Henry was to be the fourteenth member of
        Super Junior, stemming from SM's statement
        regarding the controversy, which led fans to form an "Only 13" campaign. Henry described the situation as "if
        Backstreet Boys wanted a new Boy," and he ended up "being on the sidelines for years." In October 2007, S.M.
        Entertainment announced that Henry would
        debut as a member of a Super Junior China sub-group, Super Junior-M, in 2008. They debuted by releasing a
        promotional single U. He returned to the music industry after a year-long break with the release of Super
        Junior-M's first mini-album, Super Girl, on September 23, 2009.
        The mini-album won many awards and even earned the group a nomination for "Best Vocal Group" at the 21st Golden
        Melody Awards, the Chinese equivalent of the Grammy Awards. He worked with Super Junior's leader Leeteuk again,
        and together
        they composed a song called "Andante" for Super Junior's 5th repackaged album, A-CHa, released on September 19,
        2011. Super Junior with Lau and fellow Super Junior-M member Zhou Mi released the single "Santa U Are The One",
        taken from SMTown's eighth winter album,
        2011 Winter SMTown – The Warmest Gift, released on December 13, 2011. Super Junior-M's second studio album,
        Break Down, was released on January 7, 2013, along with a lead single of the same name.</p>

      <p> The album includes two songs produced and composed by Lau's music
        production team, Noize Bank, titled "Go" and "It's You". The lyrics for both songs were written by fellow Super
        Junior-M member Zhou Mi. On May 30, 2013, it was announced that Henry would make his solo debut. He was SM
        Entertainment's first solo male artiste in 13 years since Kangta.
        His first solo extended play, Trap was released on June 7, 2013. The title track featured Super Junior's Kyuhyun
        and SHINee's Taemin. On October 10, 2016, SM Entertainment announced that Henry will collaborate with Soyou
        (Sistar) for a song called "Runnin'"
        released on October 14 through SM Station. Henry helped to compose Se7en's latest title track, "Give It To Me",
        which was released on October 13, 2016. On April 30, 2018, it was announced that Henry had completed his
        contract with SM Entertainment and that he had decided to leave the agency.
        He then set up his own studio called Henry's Workshop. In November 2018, Henry announced that he had joined
        Monster Entertainment Group, an agency based in South Korea founded by his brother, Clinton, to help build his
        brand globally. Monster Entertainment is part of a global management
        team which includes Chinese film production company Filmko and other partners in the United States. Henry is its
        first global multi-faceted artist.</p>
