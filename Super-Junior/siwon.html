      <h2>~~~Profile of SIWON SUPER JUNIOR~~~</h2>
      <p>Choi Siwon was born in Seoul, South Korea, on 10 February, 1987. He
        has one younger sister, Ji-won. His father was the former CEO of Boryung Medicine, a pharmaceutical company.
        Choi was scouted by a talent agent from SM
        Entertainment when he was 16 as he was waiting for friends in front of his high school. The agent recommended
        him to audition for the company's Starlight Casting System. He auditioned without his parent's approval; his
        parents were notified only after he
        passed the auditions. Choi debuted as part of 12-member rotational project group Super Junior 05 on 6 November
        2005 on SBS' music program Popular Songs, performing their first single, "Twins (Knock Out)". In April 2008,
        Choi was put into seven-member sub-group Super Junior-M,
        a Mandopop subgroup of Super Junior for the Chinese music industry. They debuted in China at the 8th Annual
        Music Chart Awards. In 2006, Choi was cast in the Hong Kong epic film A Battle of Wits, playing the role of the
        Liang Prince. This also marks his film debut.
        Choi received praise from co-star Andy Lau, who stated that Choi sets a good example for Hong Kong actors.</p>
      <p>After a three-year hiatus, Choi returned to the screen with SBS'
        romantic comedy Oh! My Lady. The same year, he starred in the big-budget spy series Athena:
        Goddess of War, a spin-off to the 2009 hit drama Iris. In 2012, Choi starred in SBS' comedy satire drama The
        King of Dramas, based around Korean television production. He plays Kang Hyun-min, a top celebrity with a
        prickly personality. Choi starred in multiple projects in 2015.
        He co-starred in Hong Kong historical-action film Dragon Blade with Jackie Chan, crime thriller Helios and
        sports drama To the Fore alongside Eddie Peng and Shawn Dou. In October 2017, Choi started in the tvN's youth
        romance drama Revolutionary Love, alongside
        Kang So-ra. This marked his first project after releasing from his mandatory military enlistment on 18 August
        2017. In April 2019, Choi starred in KBS’s crime comedy drama My Fellow Citizens!.</p>
